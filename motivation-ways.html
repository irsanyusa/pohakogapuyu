Maxwell</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When it comes to getting results, it takes motivation and ability.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Motivation makes things happen.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Where there’s no will, there’s no way. One of the best ways to improve your personal effectiveness is to master your motivation and find your drive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you can master motivation, you can deal with life’s setbacks, as well as inspire yourself to always find a way forward, and create new experiences for yourself, and follow your growth.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In this post, I’ll demystify motivation and give you the motivation tools that really work.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>1. Connect to your values.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is the ultimate secret. If you can connect the work you do to your values, even in small ways, you can change your game.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of my values is learning and growth.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I find ways to grow my skills in any situation. For example, I don’t just “call back a customer.” I “win a raving fan.” I don’t just “do a task.” I “master my craft.” I don’t just “get something done.” I “learn something new.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>2. Find your WHY.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Figure out a compelling purpose. Turn this into a one-liner.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For example, when I fall off the horse, I remind myself I’m here to “make others great.” This gets me back on track, sharing the best of what I know.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>3. Change your WHY.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sometimes you’re doing things for the wrong reason. Are you doing that task to get it done, or to learn something new? Just shifting your why can light your fire.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>4. Change your HOW.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You can instantly find your tasks more enjoyable by shifting from getting them done, to doing them right.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I think of it as mastering your craft. Make it artful.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sometimes slower is better. Other times, the key is to make it a game and actually speed it up. You can set time limits and race against the clock. Changing your how can get you out of ruts and find new ways to escape the mundane.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>5. Remember the feeling.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Flipping through your head movies and scenes is one of the fastest ways to change how you feel.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Remember the feeling. How did you feel during your first kiss? What about laying on the grass on a sunny day?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When you feel good, you find your motivation faster.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>6. Shift to past, present or the future.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sometimes you need to be here, now. Sometimes, the right here, right now sucks. The beauty of shifting tense is you can visualize a more compelling future, or remember a more enjoyable past.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the same time, if you catch yourself dwelling on a painful past, get back to right here, right now, and find the joy in the moment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You’ll improve your temporal skills with practice.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>7. Find a meaningful metaphor.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Find a metaphor that fuels you. Maybe you’re the “Little Engine that Could.” Maybe you’re “in your element.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The most powerful thing you can do is find a metaphor that connects to your values. This is why I turn my projects into “epic adventures.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>8. Take action.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s a secret that once you know it, can change your life. Action often comes before motivation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You simply start doing an activity and then your motivation kicks in. Nike was right with “Just do it.” For example, I don’t always look forward to my workout, but once I start, I find my flow.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>9. Link it to good feelings.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Find a way to link things to good feelings. For example, play your favorite song when you’re doing something you don’t like to do.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It has to be a song that makes you feel so great that it overshadows the pain of the task. It’s hard to tell yourself you don’t like something when it feels so good.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A similar approach is to find your theme song.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>10. Impress yourself first.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is how people like Peter Jackson or James Cameron or Stephenie Meyer inspire themselves. They make the movies or write the books that impress themselves first. They connect their passion to the work and they don’t depend on other people setting the bar. Their internal bar becomes their drive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>11. “CHOOSE” to.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you tell yourself you “HAVE” to do this or you “MUST” do that or you “SHOULD” do this, you can weaken your motivation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The power of choice and simply reframing your language to “CHOOSE” to can be incredibly empowering and exactly the motivating language you need to hear. Choose your words carefully and make them work for you.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>12. Pair up.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is one of my favorite ways to make something fun. One person’s painful task, is another’s pleasure. Pair up with somebody who complements your skill or who can mentor you and get you over the humps.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>13. Change your question.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sometimes you need to change your focus. To change your focus, change the question.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you ask yourself what’s wrong with this situation, of course you’ll find things to complain about. Ask yourself what’s right about the situation and you can quickly find the positives and get your groove on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>14. Fix time for eating, sleeping and working out.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sometimes your body or emotions are working against you because you’re not giving them a break or fueling them the right way.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One simple way to improve results here is to find a routine for eating, sleeping, and moving or working out that supports you.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>15. Play to your strengths.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spending too much time in your weaknesses wears you down. Spending more time in your strengths helps you renew your energy and find your flow.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Strengths are the place where you can grow your best. Find the things that you can do all day that you really enjoy and find excuses throughout your day to do more of that. Success builds on itself and this helps you build momentum.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Try out the motivation techniques to see what works for you.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the end of the day, all motivation really comes down to self-motivation, and you get better at motivation by building your self-awareness.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Learn how to push your own buttons from the inside out.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Join over 210,000 readers.
