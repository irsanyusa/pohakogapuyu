The hashtag #<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paris2024</a>, meanwhile, garnered over 526,700 posts. The two biggest viral stars of these Olympics are Norwegian swimmer&nbsp;Henrik Christiansen, aka Muffin Man, and U.S. pommel horse superstar Stephen Nedoroscik.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Christiansen tallied up 83 million video views with his love of chocolate muffins made in the athlete village. The organizing committee said as many 3,000 muffins were eaten daily during the Olympics, although it’s certain Christiansen didn’t eat them all. Nedoroscik, on the other hand, launched the first viral moment when he sparked comparisons with Clark Kent after winning the individual bronze medal on pommel.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We’ve also noticed that all of the amazing trends are starting on TikTok. The muffin man, the pin trading, the Turkish pistol shooter, Simone Biles biting down on the metal. These trends are starting on TikTok and we know that we’re then part of pop culture,” said Rollo Goldstaub, Tiktok’s global head of sports partnerships at a festive event held at Team GB showcasing jam-packed live performances by Natasha Bedingfield and Cat Burrns.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bedingfield raised the roof of the Team GB House as she sang “Unwritten,” along with her other hits such as “These Words.” “Unwritten” was prominently featured in “Anyone But You,” starring&nbsp;Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, and became viral again 20 years after its initial release. “Unwritten” has been used in over 1 million video creations on Tiktok and has now broken into the Billions club on Spotify.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Burrns, a double platinum selling artist who was one of TikTok’s Breakthrough Artists in 2022, sang her popular song “Go.” In the last two years, she signed a record deal with Since 93 / RCA Records and has since collaborated with Sam Smith and has toured with Ed Sheeran.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Goldstaub said he’s also looking forward to the Winter Olympics in Milan next year, and the L.A. Games in 2028.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The L.A. Games will be incredible. We’re hearing that Tom Cruise is going to be there for the handover. That already shows the stardom that we’ll see in the US for the Olympics,” said the London-based TikTok executive. “There’s so many things to be excited about in the sports space.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2traKymZLumw9Jop5qqmah6sLjYpqeim6Niwaq306iiZqifqMG0edOoorKnXWaDen2PaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
