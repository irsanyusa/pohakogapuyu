One woman faced a&nbsp;tough situation with her partner, who asked her to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;paternity test for their <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a>. The lady came to&nbsp;Reddit under the handle imshattered_ and told her <a href=# title=story data-link=tag>story</a>, seeking for people’s attention not only for the situation itself, but for the tough decision that she made about her partner and their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>.</p><p><h2>The woman came to&nbsp;the social platform, all desperate about her family situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e9/30b/c5b2635937af4fb0d154fcc304.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman who uses the nickname <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>imshattered_</a>, recently took to&nbsp;Reddit with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a> that might have resonated with any person who has family and <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a>, or&nbsp;has ever been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship. The woman sounded desperate, and her story provoked many comments with users trying to&nbsp;give her piece of&nbsp;advice. She started her post with telling to&nbsp;the audience that she’s a&nbsp;new mom to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby boy who is&nbsp;her pride and joy. The woman added that, despite her maternity being a&nbsp;rollercoaster adjusting to&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby, the past few months have been tiring but great for her.</p><p>She revealed that she has a&nbsp;partner of&nbsp;3&nbsp;years. The man is&nbsp;the first person she has ever loved, and she thought they were doing great as&nbsp;new parents but also as&nbsp;partners. But her recent discovery shook her world a&nbsp;lot.</p><p><h2>The woman’s boyfriend turned her life upside down with just one request.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db3/d24/098bc550d1855870d5f12b65a5.jpg><p>The woman continues that one day, her boyfriend and the father of&nbsp;the baby came home and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> her for a&nbsp;paternity test. She describes the whole process with mixed feeling, saying that for him, it&nbsp;was something casual. She confessed that this request was completely out of&nbsp;the blue. She was putting away the dishes, and he&nbsp;asked for one, like he&nbsp;was asking what was for dinner.</p><p>The woman explained that she’s a&nbsp;different race from her partner. But despite that, their child was literally his mirror image. The only thing that was different, was the kid’s skin tone. She elaborated that she had seen pictures of&nbsp;him when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;baby and compared to&nbsp;them, the baby and the boyfriend looked very much alike.</p><p><h2>The new mom’s reaction was quite predictable and understandable.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cab/f85/e98ff25b29ab60bc0e1e243cb3.jpg><p>As&nbsp;she went on&nbsp;with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>, the new mom recalls that she had her world collapsing just in&nbsp;one single moment. She was stunned when he&nbsp;asked and his reasons were that he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sure he&nbsp;was the father, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;have that certainty. The woman added that all she remembered as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was speaking was just immediately feeling <a href=# title=pain data-link=tag>pain</a>.</p><p>The man whom she loved didn’t trust her. The woman found it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;believe that her boyfriend could even think that she could cheat on&nbsp;him, and then try to&nbsp;pass off another man’s baby as&nbsp;his. She wrote that she had never ever given him reason to&nbsp;think she could be&nbsp;dishonest with him. On&nbsp;the contrary, she had always tried to&nbsp;be&nbsp;transparent and communicated, and now she discovered it&nbsp;wasn’t enough.</p><p><h2>The woman’s partner didn’t see anything harmful in&nbsp;his request.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8cd/401/2997a75a698009be9f24251b75.jpg><p>Apart from asking about a&nbsp;paternity test in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>casual way</a>, the woman’s boyfriend seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very calm and moderate about the whole situation. The woman recalled that he&nbsp;casually told her he&nbsp;would give her time to&nbsp;think about this.</p><p>He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;wouldn’t go&nbsp;behind her back and do&nbsp;this test but for their relationship to&nbsp;move forward, he&nbsp;claimed he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;100% sure. Her partner just repeated this because&nbsp;he, in&nbsp;his words, “needed her to&nbsp;realize how serious he&nbsp;was”. But the new mom now can’t move forward with their relationship.</p><p><h2>The woman’s decision about the future of&nbsp;their relationship was tough.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c74/66c/8fd96154de8bcbe5aa35bf12e8.jpg><p>The lady wrote that after thinking for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days, she’s now going to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>allow</a> him this paternity test. She insisted that it’s because she has nothing to&nbsp;hide. The woman is&nbsp;sure she never cheated and would have never cheated on&nbsp;her partner. But she revealed that she’s got a&nbsp;decision about their future relationship. She explained that once it’s proven that he’s the father, she’s ending&nbsp;it, leaving the same day, and she is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;try her best to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;cooperative co-parent with him.</p><p>In&nbsp;the meantime, she revealed she’s coming up&nbsp;with her exit plan, a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;live, and a&nbsp;lawyer to&nbsp;work out a&nbsp;custody arrangement and court. The woman confessed that she can’t even tell her family or&nbsp;her friends right now because they would go&nbsp;nuclear, and her first priority is&nbsp;their baby. But she said that she sincerely hopes the test was worth it&nbsp;to&nbsp;her partner.</p><p>She added she came to&nbsp;the platform not asking for advice or&nbsp;reassurance or&nbsp;to&nbsp;explain his side. She was just realizing this part of&nbsp;her life was now over. “What a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;start the new year, huh,” she added.</p><p>And here’re 20&nbsp;people who look so&nbsp;identical with their relatives that they would probably never need a&nbsp;<a href=#>DNA test</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done to&nbsp;make sure they’re related.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ec%2Baqa2mlad6or%2FKnptmnp%2BneqJ5z5qrnqqensG6edOeqq1llqS%2FbrvUq2SkoZRirq%2BwjKGcq52jYsSprdNmoKWkXZm8bsPHnqVmrJiaerOx0q6jratdmLyusYxxaG9pZG58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
