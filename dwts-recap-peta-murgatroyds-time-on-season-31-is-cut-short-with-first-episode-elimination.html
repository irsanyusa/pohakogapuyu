The show’s first theme was premiere party, where the celebrities were able to pick some of their favorite songs to dance to. After several amazing first performances, the first elimination of the Dancing with the Stars season was announced.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dancing With the Stars Kicks off With American Idol Winner</h2><p>The show kicked off with American Idol winner Jordin Sparks and Brandon Armstrong’s cha cha to “Wanna Dance With Somebody” by Whitney Houston. After the powerful performance, the judges gave the first pair a score of 26 out of 40. Since Jordin has a history on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">doing well</a> competition shows, many believe she could be the one to beat this season.</p><p>Dancing With the Star‘s third <a href=#>deaf contestant</a>, CODA star Daniel Durant impressed with Britt Stewart with their tango to “Barbra Streisand” by Duck Sauce. The pair earned positive comments from the judges, who commended them for their solid tango. The judges gave them a score of 27 out of 40. When asked, Durant explained that although he can’t hear the music, he can feel the vibrations, which makes him want to move.</p><p>Teresa Giudice decided to come to Dancing With the Stars after working on herself. This Real Housewife of New Jersey has remarried and is now ready to show off her true self. Her and partner Pasha Pashkov earned 20 out of 40 points for their tango to “We Found Love” by Rihanna.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shangela Makes History as The First Drag Queen on the Series</h2><p>The set designers of Dancing With the Stars recreated the Jersey Shore Boardwalk for the show’s star, Vinny Guadagnino. The celebrity picked the song “Titi Me Pregunto” by Bad Bunny for his first dance with partner Koko Iwasaki. The judges told Vinny that he didn’t show off his club moves enough, so the dance earned them a 17 out of 40 points. This pair had the lowest score of the night.</p><p>RuPaul’s Drag Race queen Shangela, took the stage with a bang, surprisingly without any type of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">box entrance</a>. This pair gave one of my favorite dances in the premiere episode. Their salsa to “When I Grow Up” by The Pussycat Dolls was awarded 28 out of 40 points.</p><p>TikTok sensation Charli D’Amelio finished the show off on a high note. The 18 year old and her partner Mark Ballas performed a cha cha to “Savage (Major Lazer Remix)” by Megan The Stallion. As many know, she has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">previous dance experience</a> and it clearly helped. Charli and Mark placed at the top of the board with 32 out of 40 points.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-first-elimination-of-the-season-jason-lewis-and-peta-murgatroyd>The First Elimination of The Season, Jason Lewis and Peta Murgatroyd</h2><p>At the end of the night, votes were tallied and the judge comments were taken into consideration. After the exhilarating premiere, the bottom two couples were Teresa Giudice and Pasha Paskov, and Peta Murgatroyd and Jason Lewis. After judge deliberations, they decided to send Teresa and Pasha through to the next round of DWTS. The first elimination of the Dancing With the Stars season was Jason Lewis and Peta Murgatroyd.</p><p>Dancing With the Stars returns on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney+</a> on Monday, September 26 at 8 p.m. Next week, the cast of the series will celebrate the life of Elvis, with a night dedicated to him and his music.
