But, unlike what is&nbsp;shown in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>, the path to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> is&nbsp;not covered with rose petals. And every celebrity can recall several stories from the set that they would like to&nbsp;forget like a&nbsp;horror movie.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> realize that celebrities have to&nbsp;live through many awkward moments, that’s why we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;figure out which scenes from their filmography they regret most.</p><p><h2>1. Jude Law&nbsp;— The New Pope</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ed/d53/817e855dafbf2b5528d938c164.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the trailer for the sensational series The New Pope, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene where Jude Law’s character <a href=#>walks along</a> the beach in&nbsp;a&nbsp;snow-white swimsuit, surrounded by&nbsp;girls in&nbsp;bikinis. The actor confessed at&nbsp;the Venice Film Festival that, initially, this episode was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;totally different and his character was simply walking out of&nbsp;the sea. However, at&nbsp;the last moment the director Paolo Sorrentino decided to&nbsp;spice it&nbsp;up&nbsp;and brought a&nbsp;crowd of&nbsp;half-naked women to&nbsp;the set. This change came as&nbsp;a&nbsp;big surprise for Law and he&nbsp;was very <a href=#>worried</a> about what his kids’ reaction would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;this scene.</p><p><h2>2. Ryan Gosling&nbsp;— Blue Valentine</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec1/91a/b0038159718bf427b33692d26b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Blue Valentine, there is&nbsp;quite an&nbsp;intimate bedroom scene between the characters of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Ryan Gosling" data-link=tag>Ryan Gosling</a> and Michelle Williams. Of&nbsp;course, it’s just a&nbsp;job for the actors, but still, Ryan came to&nbsp;the premiere with his mother. Gosling <a href=#>said</a> the following, “I&nbsp;watched it&nbsp;with my&nbsp;mother, she was beside&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;gave her an&nbsp;iPod. And when the naughty scenes came&nbsp;on, I&nbsp;pressed ’play’ and covered her eyes.”</p><p><h2>3. Leonardo DiCaprio&nbsp;— Don’s Plum</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e3/f62/ad57df564eb4d57a0704498c4d.jpg><p>The filmography of&nbsp;this popular actor has one film that stands out from his other work. In&nbsp;2000, DiCaprio <a href=#>played</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small budget black-and-white movie called Don’s Plum. The plot of&nbsp;the movie is&nbsp;quite simple: a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;young guys, who change girlfriends like socks, get together in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cafe every Saturday where they discuss everything going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;the world. In&nbsp;this movie, Leo <a href=#>played</a> a&nbsp;rather rude and standoffish guy named Derek who in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the scenes says dirty words to&nbsp;the girls and then throws a&nbsp;glass at&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them. It’s not surprising that DiCaprio himself confessed that he&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;<a href=#>forget</a> this acting experience altogether.</p><p><h2>4. Rupert Grint&nbsp;— Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a8/538/a8be4357709a6e1de5c9a92e16.jpg><p>The young actors had a&nbsp;great relationship on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;the famous saga. However, in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the interviews, Rupert Grint, who played Ron Weasley, <a href=#>confessed</a> that the kissing scene with Emma Watson, who played Hermione, was not very pleasant for him. “I&nbsp;never look back at&nbsp;that scene. I’ve known Emma since she was literally 9&nbsp;years old and we&nbsp;had this very brother-sister type relationship. It&nbsp;just felt very surreal. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;memory of&nbsp;her face getting closer and closer. Like, ‘Oh my&nbsp;God.’ I&nbsp;can’t really remember anything apart from that.” Luckily, the scene was filmed in&nbsp;one take.</p><p><h2>5. Emilia Clarke&nbsp;— Game of&nbsp;Thrones</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/259/fed/fbcff6535d9d5507d3e28d55a3.jpg><p><a href=# title="Emilia Clarke" data-link=tag>Emilia Clarke</a>’s parents had been carefully watching their daughter’s success and tried not to&nbsp;miss a&nbsp;single episode of&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones. But the actress didn’t want her parents to&nbsp;see her naked, which is&nbsp;why she warned her relatives about which scenes it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;better to&nbsp;skip. Moreover, after the third season, Emilia amended her contract and refused to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shot nude. Everything was perfect until the fourth episode of&nbsp;the sixth season, where the actress decided to&nbsp;appear naked on&nbsp;screen once again and forgot to&nbsp;warn her parents about&nbsp;it. Ironically, that’s the very episode Clarke <a href=#>was watching</a> with her mother and father. That definitely wasn’t a&nbsp;nice surprise.</p><p><h2>6. Samuel L. Jackson&nbsp;— The Exorcist III</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7e4/38c/1cd0ca5e609c71dd786a296845.png><p>Today Jackson is&nbsp;a&nbsp;famous actor who often gets the main roles in&nbsp;decent movies, but it&nbsp;wasn’t always like this. His small role in&nbsp;the mystical horror movie The Exorcist III&nbsp;is a&nbsp;good example of&nbsp;this. Samuel’s character <a href=#>didn’t even have</a> a&nbsp;name in&nbsp;this movie, while his role was all about depicting a&nbsp;blind person sitting with a&nbsp;walking stick against the backdrop of&nbsp;the things happening around. Definitely not the best role in&nbsp;his career.</p><p><h2>7. Amanda Seyfried&nbsp;— Chloe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b9/cea/9cd973519d92ccb51e9b5e65e2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the thriller Chloe, Amanda Seyfried had a&nbsp;difficult task&nbsp;— acting in&nbsp;an&nbsp;intimate scene with famous actress Julianne Moore. “I&nbsp;was counting down the days until we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;shoot that,” <a href=#>shared</a> Amanda in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews. To&nbsp;help the actresses figure out exactly what to&nbsp;do, the director even invited understudies so&nbsp;that they could clearly demonstrate what needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done in&nbsp;the frame. However, Amanda and Julianne persuaded the director to&nbsp;make this episode softer. Eventually, the result came out great and powerful, but the actress still feels shy when she <a href=#>recalls</a> the scene, “It&nbsp;was good, a&nbsp;nice team effort, but it&nbsp;was awkward. Because that’s what it&nbsp;is&nbsp;— awkward. Intimate scenes are awkward.”</p><p><h2>8. Mia Wasikowska&nbsp;— Lawless</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dda/5e2/a7712a50dd98f407cdb887680f.jpg><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t easy for the actress to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;scenes together with the rebellious Shia LaBeouf. The thing is&nbsp;that the actor got too into the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bootlegger and didn’t behave well on&nbsp;the set. That’s why it’s not surprising that Mia felt <a href=#>uncomfortable</a> working in&nbsp;this environment and she even wanted to&nbsp;quit.</p><p><h2>9. Jim Carrey&nbsp;— Eternal Sunshine of&nbsp;the Spotless Mind</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/04a/7f7/dd1115593bafe323978b26325c.jpg><p>The director of&nbsp;this legendary movie, Michel Gondry, once said that the scene of&nbsp;Clementine’s sudden disappearance (played by&nbsp;Kate Winslet) became one of&nbsp;his favorite ones. However, it&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;pleasant surprise for Jim Carrey because he&nbsp;<a href=#>wasn’t warned</a> that his partner would vanish. It&nbsp;scared the actor since he&nbsp;couldn’t understand what was happening. Eventually, the part was included in&nbsp;the movie.</p><p><h2>10. Terence Stamp&nbsp;— Star Wars</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10e/fec/1a4fa85805bb96a272ae600e49.jpg><p>The famous actor agreed to&nbsp;play a&nbsp;small part in&nbsp;the first part of&nbsp;the cult saga only because he&nbsp;<a href=#>liked</a> Natalie Portman. Stamp was hoping that he&nbsp;would have several common scenes with the actress. Moreover, he&nbsp;agreed to&nbsp;a&nbsp;smaller salary in&nbsp;exchange for a&nbsp;common scene with Portman. It&nbsp;turned out that Terence never even got in&nbsp;one frame with Natalie&nbsp;— he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;<a href=#>play</a> the scene with a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;paper instead. Later he&nbsp;<a href=#>confessed</a> that he&nbsp;regrets having agreed to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;the project at&nbsp;all.</p><p><h2>11. Anne Hathaway&nbsp;— Love &&nbsp;Other Drugs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e99/f70/a7de3d50a09458519ff97cfe93.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the love story Love &&nbsp;Other Drugs, the actress had several scenes where she was supposed to&nbsp;appear nude in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the camera. It&nbsp;wasn’t comfortable for Anne to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, “There is&nbsp;that revoltingly <a href=#>embarrassing</a> moment when you have to&nbsp;take your clothes off in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;strangers. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought, OK, I’m going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;control. I’m going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything properly, disrobe at&nbsp;the last minute, and in&nbsp;between shots put my&nbsp;clothes back&nbsp;on. But then&nbsp;I found that every time&nbsp;I put my&nbsp;robe back&nbsp;on, it&nbsp;rubbed all my&nbsp;body makeup off, and that added 20&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;filming.”</p><p><h2>12. Jake Gyllenhaal&nbsp;— Love &&nbsp;Other Drugs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/186/b83/5fcdd358a990858babbb1b67eb.jpg><p>This might be&nbsp;surprising, but acting in&nbsp;this movie wasn’t easy for Jake Gyllenhaal either, especially when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;bedroom scenes. Later he&nbsp;<a href=#>was joking</a>, “I’ve had a&nbsp;pretty illustrious career at&nbsp;this point, but the hardest thing has been pretending to&nbsp;be&nbsp;turned on&nbsp;by&nbsp;Anne Hathaway.” All we&nbsp;can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;get amused at&nbsp;his blunt, reaction because Anne is&nbsp;truly a&nbsp;real beauty.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Sometimes actors regret certain scenes for really peculiar reasons.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ee/52c/ebce09534eab03d805dc390989.jpg><p>Eva Mendes had a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;an&nbsp;action movie called Once Upon a&nbsp;Time in&nbsp;Mexico with Johnny Depp. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the scenes, the actors were supposed to&nbsp;kiss at&nbsp;gunpoint. Eventually, this passionate episode ends with a&nbsp;shot. Later, Eva confessed that she felt a&nbsp;huge <a href=#>disappointment</a> about this scene. And the reason wasn’t in&nbsp;Johnny’s bad kissing, but conversely, the actress regretted that the kiss was too short.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think you would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;act in&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene that you don’t like or&nbsp;would you rather refuse to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;a&nbsp;film at&nbsp;all?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zecyoraKdXaiwprrErGStoJGpeqKv06iprGWimrCiuMtmrqKsmGKvsMDHZphmqJmjsKl5zp9krKCRorJurc2dZJplo6K2rbGMcHBxbmBmfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
