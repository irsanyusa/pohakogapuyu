Earlier, on Monday, local media quoted a spokesman for the Queensland Department of Environment, Science, and Innovation as saying that a large crocodile “believed to be responsible for the fatal attack on the man was humanely euthanised.”</p><p>The reptile, measuring almost five metres in length, was spotted around 4 kilometres from where the man went missing and recognised due to distinctive markings on its snout. The crocodile was said to be decades old.</p><p>Australian media reported that the man was at the popular fishing spot with his wife and children. Authorities were also investigating reports on social media that people were seen feeding crocodiles near the scene of the accident.</p><p>Feeding crocodiles is considered a criminal offence and can be punished with a fine of around $6,452 Australian ($4,188 US). On average, two fatal crocodile attacks are reported every year in Australia. The latest incident in July saw a 12-year-old girl killed in the Northern Territory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXyzscyaoKerXaSzbrnIrKqippdigXF52J6Yq2WfobFuucCnZJ%2BnpaOxbrXNrKCdnV2Yv7Cvzp2gpZ1dnrturdSsq6uZnJ6ucK6Wp5%2BtcWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
