Maybe that’s because it’s a&nbsp;series that can be&nbsp;watched and enjoyed over and over again. But what would the series be&nbsp;without those characters who were part of&nbsp;the story, but who weren’t the stars of&nbsp;the show? What would have happened without Emily, who would Ross have called Rachel at&nbsp;the wedding? Or&nbsp;what would have happened without Richard and his influence on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> between Chandler and Monica?</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> brings you the most influential supporting characters of&nbsp;the series. You will find out what they have been doing after the show and how they have changed in&nbsp;looks over the years.</p><p><h2>1. Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/289/e43/878867565d8f76b35591b01100.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most well-known roles in&nbsp;her acting career was without any doubt that of&nbsp;<a href=#>Carol</a>, Ross’ first wife (of&nbsp;the many he&nbsp;had!), who leaves him when she falls in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> with her friend Susan (played by&nbsp;Jessica Hecht). She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;recurring character in&nbsp;the series, since she has a&nbsp;son (little Ben) with Ross.</p><p>Besides Friends, Sibbett has worked on&nbsp;<a href=#>Herman’s Head</a> and <a href=#>It&nbsp;Takes Two</a>, alongside the Olsen twins, among other <a href=# title=films data-link=tag>films</a>. She is&nbsp;actually still close to&nbsp;Jessica and they have given online <a href=#>yoga</a> classes together.</p><p><h2>2. Jessica Hecht (Susan Bunch)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24a/cfa/480b3b5abe9b24a6603af812d7.jpg><p>Carol and Susan are a&nbsp;great couple and are very popular among Friends fans (besides, if&nbsp;they hadn’t met, Ross would probably still be&nbsp;married to&nbsp;Carol and there wouldn’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;Ross and Rachel, right?). Jessica went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;pursue an&nbsp;ambitious acting <a href=#>career</a>. She took part in&nbsp;films like <a href=#>Whatever Works</a>, directed by&nbsp;Woody Allen, and <a href=#>Dan in&nbsp;Real Life</a> where she worked with Steve Carell. She also appeared in&nbsp;series like <a href=#>Breaking Bad</a>, where she played Gretchen Schwartz. But maybe you didn’t know it&nbsp;was her, since it’s hard to&nbsp;recognize her without the distinctive curls she wore in&nbsp;Friends.</p><p><h2>3. Cole Sprouse (Ben Geller)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ef/420/1f1f6d50a5bcefbdb3ef4a47a6.jpg><p>Oh, look at&nbsp;how much Ben has grown? For many of&nbsp;us, he’s still that little boy who loved to&nbsp;play pranks that he&nbsp;learned from “Aunt Rachel” and for whom Ross dresses up&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;armadillo to&nbsp;explain what Hanukkah is&nbsp;all about. Cole actually has a&nbsp;<a href=#>twin</a> brother named Dylan. Together they starred in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV show called <a href=#>The Suite Life of&nbsp;Zack &&nbsp;Cody</a>. Currently, he’s playing Jughead Jones on&nbsp;<a href=#>Riverdale</a>, a&nbsp;TV series that combines drama and mystery.</p><p><h2>4. James Michael Tyler (Gunther)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b44/5a7/c27da45d779ce6c93faca9e9bf.jpg><p>Gunther is&nbsp;the recurring character who has the most <a href=#>appearances</a> in&nbsp;the series, aside from the main characters. He&nbsp;won everyone’s affection because of&nbsp;his great and unrequited love for Rachel. In&nbsp;fact, that love once led him to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;cat that Rachel no&nbsp;longer wanted, and to&nbsp;buy all of&nbsp;Ross’ furniture when he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;it&nbsp;at&nbsp;Emily’s request (Remember? She wanted Ross to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;everything that Rachel had touched!).</p><p>James had worked in&nbsp;cafés before, and even though he&nbsp;started out as&nbsp;just another extra, he&nbsp;was chosen for the role because he&nbsp;was the only one who knew how to&nbsp;work an&nbsp;espresso machine. As&nbsp;for his <a href=#>acting career</a>, he&nbsp;has appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;TV series, including <a href=#>Episodes</a>, a&nbsp;series starring Matt LeBlanc (the actor who played Joey).</p><p><h2>5. Maggie Wheeler (Janice)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c8/fb9/eb5eb352e980f2c38b0dbbb361.jpg><p>Oh, my&nbsp;God! How many times have we&nbsp;laughed with Janice and her recurring punchline throughout the series? She’s definitely one of&nbsp;the most charismatic characters in&nbsp;Friends. Both her line and her laugh are an&nbsp;irreplaceable part of&nbsp;the series.</p><p>Since Friends, she has <a href=#>appeared</a> in&nbsp;several movies and series, always in&nbsp;supporting roles. If&nbsp;you’ve seen <a href=#>The Parent Trap</a>, then you’ve seen Maggie Wheeler on&nbsp;the big screen. She played Marva Kulp&nbsp;Jr., one of&nbsp;the camp counselors who is&nbsp;best remembered for that scene involving a&nbsp;fencing battle or&nbsp;when she and her mother fall into the trap that Hallie had set for Annie in&nbsp;her room. Aside from acting, Wheeler is&nbsp;<a href=#>passionate about music</a>. She currently directs a&nbsp;<a href=#>choir</a> in&nbsp;<a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a> called The Golden Bridge Choir.</p><p><h2>6. Mitchell Whitfield (Barry)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/18c/2fc/f56d8354f096e10cd563a59270.jpg><p>Barry was left at&nbsp;the altar by&nbsp;Rachel, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;learned in&nbsp;the first chapter of&nbsp;Friends. Without a&nbsp;doubt he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very influential character in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;the series, especially in&nbsp;the first seasons. Of&nbsp;course, he&nbsp;then pops up&nbsp;again on&nbsp;several occasions, like when he&nbsp;marries Mindy, one of&nbsp;Rachel’s closest friends from her teenage years. Rachel, who’s a&nbsp;bridesmaid at&nbsp;her wedding, has to&nbsp;see the whole family again of&nbsp;the man she stood up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the very same church a&nbsp;few years back. You might remember that the episode in&nbsp;question doesn’t end very well... Anyway, besides Friends, <a href=#>Whitfield</a> frequently works on&nbsp;series and in&nbsp;movies as&nbsp;a&nbsp;voice actor.</p><p><h2>7. Cosimo Fusco (Paolo)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/259/14a/0193615a1c823ab3bcc6a2e044.jpg><p>Cosimo played the charming Paolo, an&nbsp;Italian stud that Rachel met during a&nbsp;power failure where they fell in&nbsp;love. It’s no&nbsp;wonder he&nbsp;got Ross so&nbsp;upset. <a href=#>Cosimo</a> is&nbsp;actually Italian and lives in&nbsp;Rome, although he&nbsp;does speak English, unlike his character in&nbsp;the series. His most recent <a href=#>work</a> includes the Spanish series <a href=#>30&nbsp;Coins</a>, directed by&nbsp;Álex de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Iglesia for HBO.</p><p><h2>8. Larry Hankin (Mr. Heckles)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/404/2a0/18148456439f4f6a61ac7e357d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;being an&nbsp;actor, Hankin is&nbsp;a&nbsp;writer, producer, director, and singer. He&nbsp;played the role of&nbsp;Old Joe in&nbsp;Breaking Bad, both in&nbsp;the series and in&nbsp;the movie. And even though he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;great <a href=#>career</a> in&nbsp;the film world, he&nbsp;admits that Friends was the gig that brought him the most <a href=#>recognition</a> and fame. Besides, he&nbsp;had been there since the beginning of&nbsp;the series and he&nbsp;saw how the series continually grew, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;how the main characters evolved over the years.</p><p><h2>9. Hank Azaria (David)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c39/a43/110e7e5f9fbd2efc9b430c21e3.jpg><p>Unlike the others, Hank is&nbsp;actually not very well known for his role in&nbsp;Friends. Instead, his most defining role was the voice over for several Simpsons <a href=#>characters</a>, like Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, among others. While we&nbsp;love his vocal work, we&nbsp;remember him as&nbsp;David, the scientist and Phoebe’s love of&nbsp;her life that could somehow never&nbsp;be (and when it&nbsp;could, it&nbsp;was too late).</p><p><h2>10. Mike Hagerty (Mr. Treeger)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/976/4cf/1916a4599691673aaca129032b.jpg><p>Also known as&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Gerard Hagerty</a>, he&nbsp;played Mr. Treeger, the superintendent of&nbsp;the building where Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler lived. Besides Friends, Mike has played many supporting roles in&nbsp;<a href=#>successful</a> series, like Seinfeld, Grey’s Anatomy and Glee.</p><p><h2>11. Tom Selleck (Richard Burke)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/250/8dd/8213f356daa2e34696ff9cdb82.jpg><p>Tom is&nbsp;a&nbsp;famous actor who is&nbsp;the <a href=#>winner</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Golden Globe and an&nbsp;Emmy. He&nbsp;jumped to&nbsp;fame after <a href=#>starring</a> in&nbsp;the series <a href=#>Magnum P.I.</a> In&nbsp;fact, he’s worked in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many series and films that people don’t automatically think of&nbsp;him as&nbsp;Richard from Friends. But his part was still important: he&nbsp;was the man that Monica fell head over heels for, but their relationship didn’t work out because he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;have children (and by&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;pursue that life with Monica, it&nbsp;was too late). However, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very beloved character and there will always be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>debate</a> between fans who believe that Monica <a href=#>should have stayed</a> with him instead of&nbsp;Chandler and those who prefer Chandler’s nonchalance. All in&nbsp;all, the world might stop turning, but his mustache will always remain intact!</p><p><h2>12. Steven Eckholdt (Mark Robinson)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/419/5f1/27dec35323b2b4092cd20c85a9.jpg><p>How could we&nbsp;forget about Mark? This is&nbsp;actually the character who changed everything in&nbsp;the series forever when Rachel gets her first <a href=# title=job data-link=tag>job</a> that she really likes at&nbsp;Bloomingdale’s. Of&nbsp;course, he’s the main reason behind Ross and Rachel’s first breakup, because of&nbsp;how jealous Ross gets when he’s around. But that’s not the last game changer he&nbsp;introduces into the series. In&nbsp;the least season, he&nbsp;comes back and actually offers Rachel a&nbsp;new job in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a>... And the rest is&nbsp;history! <a href=#>Eckholdt</a> has worked on&nbsp;other series and films, but Mark remains his most popular&nbsp;TV character.</p><p><h2>13. Tate Donovan (Joshua Bergin)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90e/a4e/55624e5c20a55a00f781afb0f2.jpg><p>Jennifer Aniston and Tate Donovan were actually a&nbsp;<a href=#>couple</a> and by&nbsp;the time they were working together on&nbsp;Friends, they were in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;breakup. Poor things! Imagine having to&nbsp;work with your ex&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis and if&nbsp;that wasn’t enough, having to&nbsp;act like you’re in&nbsp;love with him. Talk about professionalism!</p><p><h2>14. Helen Baxendale (Emily Waltham)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a0/092/d29f2b53409dc1b146978d1411.jpg><p><a href=#>Baxendale</a> is&nbsp;British, like her character, and is&nbsp;also known for playing Rachel Bradley in&nbsp;<a href=#>Cold Feet</a>. However, she has decided to&nbsp;move away from <a href=#>fame</a> and focus entirely on&nbsp;her family.</p><p><h2>15. Elle Macpherson (Janine Lecroix)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/453/5c1/38b4025da29651b0e9a9e3be7c.jpg><p>We&nbsp;don’t remember seeing Joey fall in&nbsp;love many times during Friends, but one of&nbsp;the few times he&nbsp;claimed to&nbsp;have found the apple of&nbsp;his eye, was when Janine arrived. She was Joey’s roommate when Chandler moved in&nbsp;with Monica. <a href=#>Macpherson</a> is&nbsp;Australian, just like her character. She’s an&nbsp;internationally acclaimed supermodel, and in&nbsp;March this year she turned 56. No&nbsp;doubt she still has&nbsp;it!</p><p><h2>16. June Gable (Estelle Leonard)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/edb/dfd/f0aada5738864855cdff68a51d.jpg><p>Estelle was the talent agent handling Joey’s career. She might have had a&nbsp;slightly weird look and more than a&nbsp;few sketchy tips, but screenwriters and producers made her a&nbsp;unique character that was loved by&nbsp;all Friends fans. Gable <a href=#>went on</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;TV shows and films like Adam Sandler’s <a href=#>The Week&nbsp;Of,</a> but she was already a&nbsp;successful <a href=# title=Broadway data-link=tag>Broadway</a> actor before appearing in&nbsp;Friends.</p><p><h2>17. Lauren Tom (Julie)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e8/0a6/293a6e58bf9077a942091e2b5f.jpg><p>After her brief, but intense, appearance on&nbsp;Friends as&nbsp;Ross’ boyfriend, Lauren Tom continued <a href=#>working</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;voice actor for well-known cartoons like Futurama, where she does the <a href=#>voice</a> for Amy and Inez Wong.</p><p><h2>18. Jon Favreau (Pete Becker)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/268/32a/445736532cbb76bb87fa46b250.jpg><p>Who hasn’t dreamed of&nbsp;having an&nbsp;extremely rich boyfriend? That guy was Pete, Monica’s former boyfriend during season 3. On&nbsp;their first date, they went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=romantic data-link=tag>romantic</a> Italian restaurant... in&nbsp;Rome! He&nbsp;even bought her a&nbsp;restaurant where she could become the chef she always wanted to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Favreau, besides acting, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;renowned <a href=#>producer</a> who has worked on&nbsp;films like The Lion King (2019) and The Avengers franchise.</p><p><h2>19. Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/757/351/6bc49b57b29015ebf4b685d2db.jpg><p>Elizabeth was Ross’ girlfriend during season 6. She was often the subject of&nbsp;heated debate and jokes among the group because of&nbsp;the age difference between Ross and her. And the cherry on&nbsp;top: not only was she way younger, but she was also a&nbsp;student of&nbsp;Ross’s at&nbsp;the university he&nbsp;taught&nbsp;at. The relationship doesn’t end well, but we&nbsp;still fondly remember how Elizabeth got Ross to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>spring break</a> with her and some other students.</p><p><h2>20. Noelle and Cali Sheldon (Emma Geller-Green)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a85/f5a/f740195a4396fd96ca234b6aa7.jpg><p><a href=#>Noelle</a> and <a href=#>Cali</a>, twin sisters, were famous before they even realized&nbsp;it. They were barely one year old when they were playing the beautiful Emma, daughter of&nbsp;Ross and Rachel. After Friends, they worked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;few short films together.</p><p><h2>21. Paul Rudd (Michael “Mike” Hannigan)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/531/445/564dab595c857661bc3d68bc41.jpg><p>The best part of&nbsp;the love story between Mike and Phoebe is&nbsp;how they meet: Joey was supposed to&nbsp;introduce Phoebe to&nbsp;someone, but he&nbsp;totally forgets about&nbsp;it. When their double date starts, Joey improvises and claims to&nbsp;know, Mike. Of&nbsp;course, he&nbsp;didn’t have a&nbsp;friend by&nbsp;that name, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;starts yelling “Mike!” in&nbsp;the restaurant and that’s when <a href=#>Paul Rudd</a> enters the scene. Besides Friends, Rudd has had a&nbsp;successful career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=comedian data-link=tag>comedian</a> and now he&nbsp;is&nbsp;well-known for playing <a href=#>Ant-Man</a> (Scott Lang) in&nbsp;The Avengers franchise.</p><p><h2>22. Aisha Tyler (Charlie Wheeler)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8d5/67f/19cdc95993956cdb3b29629115.jpg><p>Charlie started out dating Joey, but ended up&nbsp;dating Ross, as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge love triangle (or&nbsp;actually square) that leads to&nbsp;a&nbsp;brief romance between Joey and Rachel. The “dinosaur girl,” as&nbsp;Phoebe nicknamed her, ended up&nbsp;leaving Ross for her ex-boyfriend.</p><p><a href=#>Tyler</a>, besides playing Charlie, is&nbsp;known for appearing in&nbsp;<a href=#>Criminal Minds</a>, <a href=#>Ghost Whisperer</a>, and <a href=#>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</a>, among many other series and films.</p><p><h2>Bonus: The parents</h2></p><p><h2>1. Elliott Gould (Jack Geller)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b9/462/be95925e109963f5a1f2480923.jpg><p>We&nbsp;remember Jack fondly, his innocent comments and dad jokes, the way he&nbsp;called Monica “My&nbsp;Little Harmonica,” or&nbsp;the steamy relationship with his wife that bothered their children more than once (and with reason).</p><p>Gould has a&nbsp;great career in&nbsp;the <a href=#>world</a> of&nbsp;series and films. He&nbsp;worked again with <a href=#>Marta Kauffman</a> (co-creator and executive producer of&nbsp;Friends) in&nbsp;<a href=#>Grace and Frankie</a>, where Lisa Kudrow also makes guest appearances.</p><p><h2>2. Christina Pickles (Judy Geller)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4f/29b/7b638d5c079d2a4b9065517057.jpg><p>Judy had a&nbsp;very obvious preference for Ross, that was especially clear when she constantly pointed out that Monica was not yet married. Christina is&nbsp;an&nbsp;Emmy Award winning, successful actress with a&nbsp;great <a href=#>career</a>.</p><p><h2>3. Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ba/c95/d03ce55d2cb5f9c9b30ae2a3d2.jpg><p>We&nbsp;love Sandra, a&nbsp;character that shows how it’s never too late to&nbsp;change the thing you don’t like about your life, regardless of&nbsp;society’s expectations. She divorces Rachel’s father and compares him to&nbsp;Barry so&nbsp;that her daughter understands that she never loved her father.</p><p>Thomas has an&nbsp;extensive <a href=#>career</a>. She is&nbsp;active on&nbsp;social media, like <a href=#>Instagram</a>, regardless of&nbsp;being 82&nbsp;years old! Plus, she’s a&nbsp;writer. This year she published <a href=#>What Makes a&nbsp;Marriage Last</a> with her husband Phil Donahue, with whom she has been <a href=#>married</a> since 1980. Let’s hear it&nbsp;for Marlo!</p><p><h2>4. Ron Leibman (Leonard Green)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ea/50f/6fefaa53b4a45418e82c533690.jpg><p>Rachel’s father was hard to&nbsp;get along with and found it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;understand that his daughter wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;independent.
