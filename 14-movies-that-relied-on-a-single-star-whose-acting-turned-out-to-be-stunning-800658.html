As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, the abundance of&nbsp;dialogue, people, and dynamic scenes causes excitement. But still, each movie is&nbsp;unique in&nbsp;its own way: some of&nbsp;them can boast the presence of&nbsp;numerous roles, while others can surprise viewers with the acting abilities of&nbsp;one bright star.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> always get surprised at&nbsp;how one actor can perfectly show the director’s idea and get the viewers to&nbsp;completely drown in&nbsp;the plot. Let’s reminisce about a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;these movies.</p><p><h2>1. 127 Hours (2010)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/37b/8db/be922a50c6b08d66fe401b346f.jpg><p>The aspiring fan of&nbsp;rock climbing and unexplored caves sets off on&nbsp;his next journey to&nbsp;the canyon valley. One careless move and he’s trapped.</p><p>In&nbsp;between shooting, James Franco <a href=#>was reading</a> books that he&nbsp;had hidden behind stones. He&nbsp;did this to&nbsp;distract himself from his claustrophobia. By&nbsp;the way, initially, the movie director had planned for Cillian Murphy or&nbsp;even Shia LaBeouf to&nbsp;play the main role.</p><p><h2>2. Into the Wild (2007)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9f6/8df/4b42915eebb72e0234bc21bcff.png><p>A&nbsp;young man decides to&nbsp;say no&nbsp;all the benefits of&nbsp;civilization and go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;solitary journey around the country. He&nbsp;gives all the money he&nbsp;has saved to&nbsp;a&nbsp;charity, after which he&nbsp;starts his trip through the deserted areas of&nbsp;Alaska.</p><p>The actor, Emile Hirsch, who played the main role, <a href=#>lost</a> 40&nbsp;pounds to&nbsp;plausibly convey the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hermit. He&nbsp;did all the dangerous tricks in&nbsp;the movie by&nbsp;himself.</p><p><h2>3. Bronson (2008)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0c8/032/0a697d5f3ea52bb556f5c318a1.png><p>The story of&nbsp;the “coolest prisoner in&nbsp;Great Britain” was played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Tom Hardy</a>. In&nbsp;1974, Michael Peterson robbed a&nbsp;post office and was sentenced to&nbsp;7&nbsp;years in&nbsp;prison. However, he&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;staying in&nbsp;prison for 34&nbsp;years.</p><p><a href=# title="Tom Hardy" data-link=tag>Tom Hardy</a> had several meetings with Charles Bronson and they became good friends. Charles <a href=#>said</a> that he&nbsp;considered Hardy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only person who could play him. The real Bronson wasn’t allowed to&nbsp;watch the movie, but he&nbsp;<a href=#>said</a> that if&nbsp;his mother liked the flick, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;enough for him.</p><p><h2>4. Gravity (2013)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/87f/568/e5e3f156868ff5a1a79a230409.png><p>A&nbsp;medical engineering specialist is&nbsp;sent into <a href=# title=space data-link=tag>space</a> to&nbsp;conduct some scientific research. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;an&nbsp;unforeseen situation, a&nbsp;disaster occurs.</p><p><a href=# title="James Cameron" data-link=tag>James Cameron</a> <a href=#>called</a> Gravity the best cosmic flick. By&nbsp;the way, almost&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;the movie is&nbsp;computer <a href=#>graphics</a>. Even the legendary Avatar consists only&nbsp;60% computer graphics.</p><p><h2>5. The Martian (2015)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ed8/afa/75ec4c5a179768d6a9462e122f.png><p>Due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;upcoming storm, the “Арес-3” crew has to&nbsp;urgently leave the planet. During the evacuation, the engineer and biologist, Mark Watney, disappears and the crew assumes he&nbsp;has died.</p><p>The solo scenes with <a href=# title="Matt Damon" data-link=tag>Matt Damon</a> <a href=#>were shot</a> for 5&nbsp;weeks straight. As&nbsp;strange as&nbsp;it&nbsp;might sound, 4&nbsp;days before the planned release of&nbsp;the film, NASA announced that salt water may still be&nbsp;flowing over the surface of&nbsp;Mars.</p><p><h2>6. Man Push Cart (2005)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9b2/531/45a8a6578592d4baa2d2564758.png><p>A&nbsp;migrant named Ahmad spends every night in&nbsp;motion by&nbsp;moving his heavy cart across the streets of&nbsp;New York. And the question&nbsp;is: will he&nbsp;ever be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;change his fate?</p><p>The famous cinema critic Roger Ebert <a href=#>declared</a>, “The flick was filmed in&nbsp;Manhattan by&nbsp;an&nbsp;American born in&nbsp;Iran and an&nbsp;American born in&nbsp;Pakistan. Free of&nbsp;contrived melodrama and phony suspense, it&nbsp;ennobles the hard work by&nbsp;which its hero earns his daily bread.”</p><p><h2>7. The Machinist (2004)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de8/772/951ae252589a00a9f10eab6612.jpg><p>Trevor Reznik, a&nbsp;factory worker, has been suffering from insomnia for one year. That’s why it&nbsp;becomes more and more difficult for him to&nbsp;distinguish a&nbsp;crazy dream from a&nbsp;no&nbsp;less crazy reality. Each scene of&nbsp;this movie is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;unbelievable tension.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, <a href=# title="Christian Bale" data-link=tag>Christian Bale</a> lost 63&nbsp;pounds by&nbsp;his own <a href=#>initiative</a> to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;the flick. Later, the actor <a href=#>admitted</a> that it&nbsp;was difficult for him to&nbsp;even run in&nbsp;some scenes due to&nbsp;such a&nbsp;rapid weight loss.</p><p><h2>8. Phone Booth (2002)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a0b/171/c7d27e52e8a73e79a2a7d46c55.png><p>How do&nbsp;you think a&nbsp;usual phone call can change the life of&nbsp;one person? Stu Shepard instinctively decides to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;the phone and answer a&nbsp;call, and ends up&nbsp;getting involved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;terrible game.</p><p>The scene where Stu confesses everything was done in&nbsp;the <a href=#>first take</a> and Colin Farrell’s tears were real. He&nbsp;got a&nbsp;round of&nbsp;loud <a href=#>applause</a> from everyone present on&nbsp;the set for his perfect acting right after shooting this scene.</p><p><h2>9. The Truman Show (1998)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/187/4d5/cf818b5de48edb147285c8e69c.png><p>Truman lives his quiet life in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small city: he&nbsp;goes to&nbsp;work, dates a&nbsp;girl, and hangs out with friends. Suddenly he&nbsp;starts to&nbsp;realize that everything around him is&nbsp;fake, while the people who surround him are professional actors.</p><p>This flick became the first serious piece of&nbsp;drama for Jim Carrey. The original plot of&nbsp;the movie was much <a href=#>darker</a>: in&nbsp;it&nbsp;Truman goes crazy, fights, and cheats on&nbsp;his wife.</p><p><h2>10. Rear Window (1954)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5cd/bb3/d396f155248cdaea376c826f33.png><p>After injuring his leg, and now unable to&nbsp;leave the house, a&nbsp;photojournalist has to&nbsp;spend all of&nbsp;his time in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wheelchair. Gradually, out of&nbsp;boredom, he&nbsp;begins to&nbsp;watch his neighbors, whose windows overlook the courtyard.</p><p>At&nbsp;the moment the movie was created, the sets for this movie were the <a href=#>biggest</a> in&nbsp;the Paramount Pictures studio. However, it&nbsp;was Grace Kelly who was the main star and who attracted all the attention on&nbsp;the set&nbsp;— the whole crew <a href=#>looked forward</a> to&nbsp;seeing her day in&nbsp;and day out.</p><p><h2>11. I&nbsp;Am Legend (2007)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/481/93b/dabf995900a945c9d10d42a05e.png><p>The movie is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;novel with the same name about an&nbsp;unknown virus that turned the biggest part of&nbsp;the planet’s population into zombie-vampires.</p><p>Will Smith <a href=#>fell for</a> the dog who he&nbsp;acted together with. He&nbsp;became so&nbsp;attached to&nbsp;the dog that he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;adopt him after the shooting was over, but the dog’s trainer refused. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get ready for the role properly, Will <a href=#>communicated</a> with former prisoners trying to&nbsp;understand what being completely alone was like.</p><p><h2>12. Cast Away (2000)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/01f/169/be595c5bc3b65e5d1fcad73581.png><p>Chuck Noland is&nbsp;a&nbsp;worker for the international delivery service FedEx. During another delivery, the main character gets into an&nbsp;airplane crash but miraculously stays alive and ends up&nbsp;being stranded on&nbsp;an&nbsp;abandoned island.</p><p>During the shooting, Tom Hanks had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through serious testing because he&nbsp;had cut his leg so&nbsp;much that it&nbsp;led to&nbsp;further infection. The doctor told him, “What’s the matter with you? You could have died from this thing.”</p><p><h2>13. Falling Down (1993)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/31f/b89/5e4963587d9d7d79b90bdf4ee3.png><p>William Foster is&nbsp;vexed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;bad luck: his boss sends him on&nbsp;indefinite leave and the court forbids him to&nbsp;meet with his daughter. Having finally lost faith in&nbsp;humanity, the main character intends on&nbsp;getting revenge.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, Michael Douglas considers the role in&nbsp;this movie to&nbsp;be&nbsp;his <a href=#>favorite</a> one. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the scenes, Foster <a href=#>says</a> that golf is&nbsp;for old men who have nothing else left to&nbsp;do. Ironically, in&nbsp;his real life, Douglas is&nbsp;an&nbsp;avid golfer.</p><p><h2>14. Moon (2009)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/921/72e/39ef5f521ab1983c16ea02ec66.png><p>The main character, Sam, has lived on&nbsp;the moon for 3&nbsp;years and is&nbsp;looking after the station for the extraction of&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare gas. His contract is&nbsp;coming to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end and he&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back home. However, it’s impossible to&nbsp;spend this much time alone without it&nbsp;leaving a&nbsp;trace on&nbsp;the psyche.</p><p>The script <a href=#>was written</a> especially for Sam Rockwell. By&nbsp;the way, Kevin Spacey read the script and <a href=#>agreed</a> to&nbsp;voice GERTY but only after the shooting was over and he&nbsp;made sure that he&nbsp;liked the movie. Eventually, he&nbsp;recorded his words in&nbsp;just half a&nbsp;day.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think one actor is&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;movie successful?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH51ecyoraKdo2LBqa3TZqmepJmasW67zWaYZquZo7StsYysq5qqXay1sL%2FEZpicrJmjtG7A1KulnpxdpMK1edOoZJudXajBtrrNoqWgZWhlfXeBl2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
