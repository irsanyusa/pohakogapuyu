If you had any interest in country music and were a contestant on the show, you picked Blake as your coach. But this season Miley Cyrus wants to steal some of Blake’s country thunder using her pedigree to lure singers away from him.</h4><p>There is no doubt that Blake Shelton has the chops to help country artists reach their full potential. After all, he’s a successful country artist in his own right. But Miley has really been pushing her country music background. She even dressed the part on Tuesday night in a denim and rhinestones outfit straight out of The Grand Old Opry. Her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, is a famous country artist as well and Miley grew up in Nashville surrounded by the country music world. Dolly Parton is her godmother, for God’s sake! However, her own career is steeply rooted in pop music.</p><p>Miley first gained fame as Hannah Montana and then, later, became an internationally famous pop star with songs like Wrecking Ball. It looks as though now, older and a little wiser, she wants to leave her wild child antics behind her and be taken seriously as an artist. Her campaign seems to be working. On last night’s show, country singer Ashland Craft picked Miley and not Blake as her coach. It also helps that Miley is bringing her dad Billy Ray on as a mentor. We’ll see if Miley gets anywhere with her country ambitions.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ashland_Voice.jpg alt="The Second ‘The Voice’ Blind Auditions Show Was Amazing" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWaZnpl6rrXLnrBmm6mnwrR5wZqrraSVYrOwvoycpq6mpKfGbq3RraCsrKNivK9506GcZq6fnrCmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
