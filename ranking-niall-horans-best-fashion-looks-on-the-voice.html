Olive Green Collared Sweater</h3><p>During The Voice Season 23 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Rounds</a>, Horan kept it casual with an olive green collared sweater, that he layered on with a white shirt. He matched this piece with a pair of black denim pants and black loafers. Then, to complete the look, he accessorized himself with small pieces of silver jewelry.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-denim-on-denim>7. Denim on Denim</h3><p>Horan is definitely not shying away from sporting the Canadian tuxedo. In another Season 23 Battle Round episode, the pop singer slipped on a short-sleeved denim shirt to pair with his denim jeans. This whole ensemble gave off a dashing vibe, a stylish clean look for the new coach.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-sheer-green-knit-top>6. Sheer Green Knit Top</h3><p>During the Season 23 Playoffs, Horan decided to wear an outfit with a pop of color. Wearing a pair of ivory pants and white shirt, Horan completed the ensemble with a sheer plain green knit top. This is perhaps one of his most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">effortless</a> yet slick looks on the show.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-dark-brown-suit>5. Dark Brown Suit</h3><p>For the Season 23 Finale, the pop singer went for a beautiful dark brown suit. Underneath, Horan was wearing a light blue silky shirt to make entire look two-toned. To complete the outfit, Horan wore a pair of black shoes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-elephant-print-vest>4. Elephant Print Vest</h3><p>One thing about Horan’s fashion style is that he can look cute and manly at the same time. For his Season 24 Battle Rounds outfit, Horan wore a vest embroidered with elephant icons on it. He used the same to layer his basic white tee and and complement his navy blue pants.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-light-taupe-vest>3. Light Taupe Vest</h3><p>In another one of his Season 24 Battle Rounds episodes, Horan slipped on a plain light taupe vest on his white tee. He’s made the outfit a little cowboy-ish by donning a good pair of light-washed denim jeans. This look is simple but has nonetheless given an edgy vibe.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-ivory-suit>2. Ivory Suit</h3><p>During the Season 23 Live Shows, Horan was donning a luxurious ivory suit to seize the exciting night. The new coach paired the dazzling terno with a vertically striped shirt underneath. With his usual silver accessories, this look stunned on the singer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-bejeweled-suit>1. Bejeweled Suit</h3><p>The Season 23 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Finale</a> marked the end of Horan’s first season on The Voice, and he obviously honored the special occasion by wearing a ravishing suit. For the night, he wore a matching black top and pant set bejeweled with multicolored flowers. It’s a no-brainer — it’s his best outfit on the show as of writing.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_SofiaVergara_ModernFamily-220x147.jpg alt="Sofia Vergara’s Best Moments as Gloria Pritchett on ‘Modern Family’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570ZqlpKGenHqvtcClo2agn6eur7%2BMm5ysrF2brrS0yKilZqSfpLi0ec6nZK2glWLDsLXCnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
