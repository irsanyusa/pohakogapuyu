Naira Marley came and also broke through to the UK with the help of him being in the UK music scene before switching to Afrobeats. But with Asake, it’s like he was destined for this moment. To see an artist sell out the o2 in their second breakthrough year is an extremely big achievement for Afrobeats, and it is even bigger when you put the perspective of his lyrics being mostly Yoruba. I am even pretty sure he is the first Afrobeats artist to fully sell out the O2( using the full 20k capacity), although that may need to be verified against Davido’s 2019 O2 concert. Asake’s rise to fame is something of Nigerian folklore, something many would’ve never seen coming," Solomun Lang said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/42765fd4d6f97652.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"She's so young": Clips of Asake's mum at son's O2 Arena show trends, fans hail her looks</span></p></a><h2>Asake sets record with O2 Arena show</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile,<strong> Legit.ng </strong>reported that Asake trended online across all social media platforms in the Nigerian space over his UK show.</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>Amapiano crooner set a new record </a>as the sixth Nigerian artist to sell out the 02 Arena.</p><p class=align-left>Also, his<a href=#> 'Asake Live at 02 Arena'</a> show made history in terms of streaming, hitting over 100k streamers.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZqbWVlfXmAjJqqmqOVYr%2BmrcKtqmain567tHnWorGkoZRir7a%2BzZpkm6epYrGiwsidpmanYmKus7HNmmSsp5yZerS0zrBkr6GUmrxuuMSarZ6rXZzCtLTIp55o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
