He had a troubled childhood and frequently got into trouble for fighting and stealing. In 1924, he was convicted of assault and battery with intent to rob and was sentenced to prison.</p><p>While in prison, Dillinger learned from seasoned criminals and developed his skills in bank robbery. After his release in 1933, he formed the Dillinger Gang and carried out a series of bank robberies across the Midwest. His crimes gained widespread media attention, and he was often portrayed as a modern-day Robin Hood figure.</p><p>Dillinger was captured in Arizona in 1934 but later escaped from jail using a fake gun. He then underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance. He was eventually betrayed, however, by brothel owner Ana Cumpănaș, who informed the FBI of his whereabouts.</p><p>In July of 1934, Dillinger was tracked to the Biograph Theater in Chicago, outside of which he was shot and killed by federal agents.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>June 22</a>, <a href=#>1903</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Indianapolis, Indiana, USA</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Greatest Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Rabbit</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Cancer</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>July 22</a>, <a href=#>1934</a> (aged 31)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Shot</a> dead by federal agents at the Biograph Theater in Chicago</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Life of Crime</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1933-06-10</a> <a href=#>John Dillinger</a> robs his first bank, in New Carlisle, Ohio.
