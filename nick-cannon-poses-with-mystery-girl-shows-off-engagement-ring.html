This time, he’s swayed away from the baby announcements to share something completely different, an engagement! Days after reminiscing on his relationship with Mariah Carey.</strong></p><p>After saying he’d never marry again, it seems like Nick Cannon might be in engaged. We’re putting a hard emphasis on might because it’s possible this is all an advertising gimmick for an upcoming music video.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-nick-cannon-engaged-to-bre-tiesi>Is Nick Cannon Engaged to Bre Tiesi?</h2><p>On July 14, Cannon posted an intimate photo with a mystery girl. Other news outlets believe the mystery girl is model <a href=#>Bre Tiesi</a>, but her identity has not been confirmed at this time (since Cannon didn’t tag her in the photo). The second photo posted by The Masked Singer host features a massive ring. To fully share the experience (or sell the narrative), Cannon published the photo with a lovey-dovey caption.</p><p>“I said I would never do it again but…Finally doing what the world wants me to do,” he wrote.</p><p>There’s a variety of comments left on this post. While some people are congratulating Cannon, others are speculating that it’s a hoax. It’s especially hard to believe that Cannon would be ready to settle down after admitting his relationship with Carey was “<a href=#>like a fairy tale</a>.”</p><p>“I think it’s a music video, lol she ain’t none of his baby mommas,” a fan commented on Instagram.</p><p>In late June, Tiesi came clean about her relationship with The Masked Singer host. She admitted that they have been “on and off” for years and currently don’t define their relationship. They are not in a monogamous relationship, but they also don’t consider themselves to be in a polygamy or open relationship. At the time, she acknowledged that she’s happy with their current arrangement. For those who may not know, Tiesi is currently expecting her first child with Cannon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>This Could Be A Marketing Gimmick</h2><p>While many people are excited for The Masked Singer host, others think this could be for a music video. This could easily be a behind the scenes photo from the music video taping of “I Do” featuring Chris Brown. Since the song’s release, it has brought in over 241,000 views on YouTube.</p><p>“I Do” features the singer opening up about his dreams of a marriage, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if the photo was a marketing tactic. Cannon has yet to acknowledge if he is really engaged, or not. Fans expect to receive a music video release date in the near future.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/90-year-old-contestants-agt.png alt="90-Year-Old Contestants Who Proved Themselves on ‘Got Talent’ Shows" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Nick Cannon</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKapGWTlruvu81mp6irlah6uLXToWSmsaOpsrPFjKCgq6RdqLWww9Jmpp%2BeXZq7qK3GnqSepqRiv6q6xmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
