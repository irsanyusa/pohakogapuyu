The vast majority of people in the UK – 89% – say physical appearance matters, either a great deal (46%) or somewhat (43%).</p><p data-block-key=3k79f>This view is held more by women than men. Half of the women (52%) say physical appearance nowadays matters ‘a great deal’, compared to 39% of men who say the same. This view is particularly prevalent among 16-24-year-old women, where six in ten (61%) share this opinion.</p><p data-block-key=hsny7>Just 9% of Britons say that physical appearance doesn’t matter very much or at all today.</p><h3 data-block-key=t9928>The impact of looks on favouritism and personality</h3><p data-block-key=vyo3v>Our research reveals that nearly nine in ten Britons (87%) think that those who are better looking are treated more favourably because of their good looks. Just 5% think those who are better looking are treated neither favourably nor unfavourably and 3% think they are treated less favourably.</p><p data-block-key=8au42>Men aged 16-24 are less likely than women in the same age cohort (80% vs 91%) to think pretty people are treated better, as do 25-39-year-old men (81%) when compared to women the same age (89%). This distinction, however, disappears among older age groups: 88% of men vs 90% women aged 40-59 both say more attractive people get better treatment, and so do 87% of men vs 86% women aged 60 and older.</p><p data-block-key=96vw8>If people are treated differently because of their looks, then it makes sense that looks could affect people’s personalities. Two-thirds of of Britons (68%) think that a person’s looks make a difference to their personality, including 16% who it has a “great deal” of impact.</p><p data-block-key=perux>The older people are, the more likely they are to think that looks impact personality: 61% of those aged 16-24 compared to 69% of those aged over 40.</p><p data-block-key=n2gie>A quarter (25%) think that looks don’t have much or any impact on the way somebody behaves as a person.</p><h3 data-block-key=mxfjf>Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?</h3><p data-block-key=pxsxh>The meaning of beauty and whether it is universal or not has been widely <a href=#>debated</a>.</p><p data-block-key=7evfs>Seven out of ten Britons (69%) think physical beauty is mostly subjective – that is to say it is more dependent on a person’s own feelings and opinions. Fewer than one in five (18%) think that beauty is more objective. There is a notable gap between young and old men when it comes to this question: among men 60 and older, 75% think beauty is mostly subjective, while this view is shared by 65% of men aged 16-24.</p><h3 data-block-key=gn4kx>Do women and men have different perceptions of beauty?</h3><p data-block-key=iowy1>Seven out of ten Britons (69%) think men and women perceive physical beauty differently. Women (74%) are more likely than men (64%) to hold this view, and 16-24-year-old women in particular are more likely to think so compared to 16-24 year old men (74% vs 56%).</p><p data-block-key=hu8qq>Only a quarter of men (26%) and one in five women (19%) think both genders have similar understandings of beauty.</p><p data-block-key=oyusv>This article is part of a wider study conducted by YouGov:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZmxtaGiBbrzHsqqim5GheqK8z56Yq5memLJuwM6dmLKrXai8pLXErbA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
