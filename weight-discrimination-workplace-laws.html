This long-standing doctrine recognizes that employment is voluntary and indefinite for both employers and employees — and can be terminated at any time for any reason by either party.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are, of course, exceptions to this rule. Federal law <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">prohibits</a> employers from firing employees on the basis of race, color, age, gender, religion or natural origin. (While the Obama administration included sexual orientation and gender identity <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">among those protected classes</a>, the Justice Department <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filed court papers</a> in July arguing that those groups are not protected by federal discrimination laws.) Federal law also precludes employers from terminating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">employees</a> on the basis of having disability. Additionally, employers cannot ax <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">employees</a> for filing a discrimination or harassment suit, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a> the company’s illegal or unsafe practices or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taking</a> family medical leave.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But these federal anti-discrimination laws provide little to no protection for overweight employees — even though there’s plenty of evidence that weight discrimination is a real phenomenon. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2008 study </a>conducted by researchers at Yale University found that 10% of women and 5% of men had experienced discrimination based on their weight, including being rejected for a job. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 study</a> from Vanderbilt University found that overweight women are paid less than their male colleagues across a variety of industries.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some U.S. cities like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">San Francisco</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Binghamton, N.Y</a>. have passed legislation preventing weight discrimination. But Michigan is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only state</a> that has an explicit law on the books. The law, which was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">passed in 1976</a>, also forbids discrimination on the basis of age and height.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The cases:</b> The Michigan law faced a major test in 2010 when former Hooters waitress Cassandra Smith filed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit</a> against the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“breastaurant” chain</a>, alleging that managers at the Roseville restaurant where she worked told her that if she didn’t lose weight in 30 days, she would face a “separation” from the company. A month later, another former employee of the Roseville branch, Leanne Convery, claimed the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">same thing had happened to her.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">denied</a> Smith and Convery’s specific claims, but didn’t deny enforcing standards on appearance. “We will say that our practice of upholding an image standard based on appearance, attitude and fitness for Hooters girls is both legal and fair,” a spokesperson for the company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said at the time</a>. “It is not unlike the standard used by the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders or the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes.” (The case was later settled in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">private arbitration</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Weight discrimination has also faced challenges in states that don’t have laws explicitly forbidding it on the books. In 2013, a federal judge <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">heard the case</a> of 22 former cocktail waitresses at the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City, N.J., who said that their employer discriminated against their weight. The women, who the casino referred to as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Borgata Babes</a>,” claimed that the casino prohibited them from gaining <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more than seven percent</a> of their original body weight. Some claimed that they were told to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">take laxatives</a> to shed pounds before mandatory company weigh-ins.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In July 2013, Atlantic County Superior Court Judge Nelson Johnson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled</a> that the casino’s policy did not constitute sex discrimination, noting that all of the women signed statements agreeing to the terms. “The Borgata Babe program has a sufficient level of trapping and adornments to render its participants akin to ‘sex objects’ to the Borgata’s patrons. Nevertheless, for the individual labeled a babe to become a sex object requires that person’s participation,” Johnson wrote, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the <i>The Press of Atlantic City</i></a>. “Plaintiffs cannot shed the label babe; they embraced it when they went to work for the Borgata.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>What it means for women:</b> The Hooters and Borgata Babes cases both employed an “image standard” to defend and enable the behavior of the employers. But that image standard is really a double standard. We already know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">women are judged more harshly</a> than men for their physical appearance. But overweight women face such criticism at even harsher levels — from both men and women.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A 2016 study found that male job interviewers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">judged overweight </a>female candidates more harshly than overweight male candidates, while female job interviewers judged both female and male overweight candidates harshly. “When it comes to ‘beauty,’ being an overweight woman is judged negatively by both sexes whereas men are a lot more forgiving towards each other,” Sonia Oreffice, a professor of the University of Surrey and the study’s lead author, said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> at the time. “Body size matters for wages, not simply as proxy for beauty.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Borgata Babes case sets a dangerous precedent. Courts are essentially allowing employers to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">body shame</a> their employees, which studies have shown to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">harmful</a> effects on women’s health. Though both of these cases involved companies that employ women primarily as eye candy, it’s not hard to see how employers in other fields could cite the Borgata Babes decision to argue in favor of an “image standard” in their offices.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And, perhaps more devastatingly, it reinforces the archaic cultural idea that women are valued <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">entirely on how they look</a> rather than their skill set, experience or talent. And deeming overweight women less valuable can have detrimental effects on their bottom line, whether it’s getting paid less or getting passed over for a job or promotion. We’ve waited long enough to highlight just how harmful weight discrimination can be — it’s time to shine a light on these practices and stop punishing people for their body size.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Areva Martin is an attorney, advocate, television host, legal and social issues commentator and author.
