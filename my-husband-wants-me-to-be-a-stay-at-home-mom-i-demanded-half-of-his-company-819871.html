She shared her story on&nbsp;Reddit and sparked a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;discussion online. Let’s find out more about their unique marriage negotiation and how their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> can change in&nbsp;the future.</p><h2>Her husband <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> her to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;stay-at-home mom.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a42/ded/7d448050119329ae081df4112b.jpg><p>My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have been married for 6&nbsp;years, and we&nbsp;have 2&nbsp;children and one on&nbsp;the way. He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;housewife and stop working. I&nbsp;was very disturbed by&nbsp;that, but he&nbsp;explained that it&nbsp;was better for our family and children since he&nbsp;can afford very good living.</p><p><h2>She asked for half of&nbsp;the company.</h2></p><p>After a&nbsp;few weeks thinking&nbsp;I told him that&nbsp;I would agree but only if&nbsp;I get 1/2 his company. The look on&nbsp;his face was priceless. He&nbsp;was shocked but said okay.</p><p>I&nbsp;explained further that the more&nbsp;I stay at&nbsp;home, the less chance I’d have to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;well paying job should we&nbsp;ever divorce. I’d have fewer merits, while he’d stay making more money each year, so&nbsp;I wanted half of&nbsp;the company.</p><p><h2>Legal and financial implications of&nbsp;their agreement.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;never divorce, then it&nbsp;wouldn’t matter, but should it&nbsp;end, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the price of&nbsp;me&nbsp;staying home and raising our children so&nbsp;he&nbsp;could be&nbsp;less worried and stressed out (in&nbsp;his words, less anxious if&nbsp;he&nbsp;knew they were with me&nbsp;rather than with strangers in&nbsp;daycare or&nbsp;nannies).</p><p><h2>How her friends reacted.</h2></p><p>When I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;friends, they called me&nbsp;selfish. My&nbsp;best friend was very angry and called me&nbsp;disgusting. So&nbsp;I’m taken aback a&nbsp;little.</p><p><h2>People took her side.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cce/39a/4f27e3542aaeb7ca22205e2b44.jpg><ul><li>You shouldn’t bend on&nbsp;this. You have as&nbsp;much a&nbsp;right to&nbsp;a&nbsp;secure financial future as&nbsp;he&nbsp;does. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn’t do&nbsp;this, he&nbsp;can’t afford you, or&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;looking to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;power imbalance that puts you at&nbsp;a&nbsp;disadvantage.<br>In&nbsp;future, keep your marital business to&nbsp;yourself. Your friends don’t get a&nbsp;vote. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Unknown author&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>To&nbsp;me, this sounds reasonable for exactly the reasons you’ve given. You don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the bitter woman finding out in&nbsp;her 50s that waiting tables is&nbsp;her only option because her professional career skills have passed their due date, and your husband has moved&nbsp;on. You don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;trapped in&nbsp;a&nbsp;loveless or&nbsp;even toxic marriage because you’re financially dependent. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Playful_Robot_5599&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I’m a&nbsp;man and&nbsp;I see nothing wrong with your request, you’re just protecting yourself and your future in&nbsp;case things go&nbsp;south. You have every right to&nbsp;have financial security. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Unknown author&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>Let’s break down the deal.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e06/c9e/1a51a15fb2be53d706555bc41f.jpg><ul><li>First things first, they need to&nbsp;figure out how much the company is&nbsp;actually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worth</a>. This isn’t as&nbsp;simple as&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;the bank account. Experts will look at&nbsp;things like how much money the company makes, what it&nbsp;owns, and how much it&nbsp;could sell for.</li><li>If&nbsp;they agree on&nbsp;a&nbsp;value, the wife would basically become a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>part-owner</a> of&nbsp;the company. This means she gets a&nbsp;say in&nbsp;how it’s run, and she’ll get a&nbsp;share of&nbsp;the profits (or&nbsp;losses).</li><li>There are a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;legal things to&nbsp;think about, like taxes and what happens after a&nbsp;divorce. They should talk to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawyer to&nbsp;figure out all the details. A&nbsp;prenup or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>postnup</a> could help protect both of&nbsp;them in&nbsp;the long run.</li><li>Becoming a&nbsp;stay-at-home parent is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big deal. They need to&nbsp;talk about how this change will affect their relationship, their family life, and their future plans. It’s important to&nbsp;have open and honest conversations about expectations and how they’ll navigate this new chapter together.</li></ul><p><h2>Advice for couples facing similar situations.</h2></p><ul><li><strong>Talk openly</strong>: Make sure you and your partner talk honestly about what you both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>want</a>. Share your thoughts and feelings about staying home or&nbsp;working so&nbsp;you’re on&nbsp;the same page. This kind of&nbsp;spousal negotiation is&nbsp;key to&nbsp;understanding each other and navigating your family dynamics.</li><li><strong>Think about money</strong>: Discuss how living on&nbsp;one income will affect your finances. Consider financial fairness in&nbsp;marriage and make a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>plan</a> for saving money, planning for the future, and having a&nbsp;backup in&nbsp;case something goes wrong.</li><li><strong>Protect yourself</strong>: If&nbsp;one of&nbsp;you is&nbsp;giving up&nbsp;a&nbsp;job, think about how you can <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>protect</a> yourself financially. Marital agreements and understanding the legal aspects of&nbsp;marriage might be&nbsp;necessary. Make sure you’re both covered in&nbsp;case things don’t work out.</li><li><strong>Plan for the future</strong>: Even if&nbsp;you stay home now, keep in&nbsp;mind how you could go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;work later. Staying prepared can help you manage stay-at-home parent challenges. Stay in&nbsp;touch with your field, keep learning, and be&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>return</a> to&nbsp;the workforce if&nbsp;you need&nbsp;to.</li><li><strong>Check in&nbsp;regularly</strong>: Set aside time to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talk</a> about how things are going. This way, if&nbsp;something isn’t working, you can fix it&nbsp;before it&nbsp;becomes a&nbsp;bigger issue. Spousal negotiations about parenting roles will help ensure that both partners feel respected and appreciated.</li></ul><p>Dealing with in-laws can be&nbsp;tricky, especially when cultural traditions and personal goals don’t line&nbsp;up. In&nbsp;<a href=#>this story</a>, a&nbsp;woman talks about how she stood up&nbsp;for herself and followed her career dreams, even though her husband’s family had more traditional expectations for her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6uK3NrapmpZViwbB5wZ5kmmWjqa66ecCtZKGnnZp6rrvMZqBmnJWirq%2BwxJ1koZmcm3qwsoyhoKxlk6S6sa3NsmRxaWlthHJ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
