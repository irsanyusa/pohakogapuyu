Why haven’t we&nbsp;discovered so&nbsp;much of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Ocean data-link=tag>Ocean</a>? Is&nbsp;our <a href=# title=planet data-link=tag>planet</a> a&nbsp;perfect sphere? And was the Earth once more purple than green? I&nbsp;bet you didn’t know these facts about our planet, so&nbsp;let’s find it&nbsp;all out!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7ff/c3c/e666925983aaf21e016f7ffa9f.png><p>Australia is&nbsp;really massive&nbsp;— to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;understand its size, it’s nearly as&nbsp;large as&nbsp;the entire <a href=# title=Europe data-link=tag>Europe</a>. Home to&nbsp;around 26&nbsp;million people, Australia is&nbsp;among the countries with the least population per area. It’s ranked only 55th for the highest population in&nbsp;the world, while it&nbsp;has the 6th largest land area. Why is&nbsp;so&nbsp;much of&nbsp;it&nbsp;empty? A&nbsp;good guess would be&nbsp;the many dangerous animals hiding behind every rock. At&nbsp;least, this is&nbsp;enough for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid Australia, but there is&nbsp;one specific reason to&nbsp;explain this.</p><p>The dryness of&nbsp;Australia ensures that&nbsp;85% of&nbsp;the population lives within 30&nbsp;miles of&nbsp;the coast. And&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;them live along the eastern side, where rainfall is&nbsp;more common. But although there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;overall lack of&nbsp;rainfall, only&nbsp;20% of&nbsp;Australia is&nbsp;an&nbsp;unlivable <a href=# title=desert data-link=tag>desert</a>, and only&nbsp;40% is&nbsp;considered not habitable by&nbsp;human standards. The water consumption is&nbsp;actually higher than their average rainfall each year.</p><p>But there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;further, ancient water source hidden away below, which can support a&nbsp;much larger population. It’s one of&nbsp;the largest underground freshwater resources in&nbsp;the world, the Great Artesian Basin. It&nbsp;covers a&nbsp;staggering 656,000 square miles, which is&nbsp;one-fifth the size of&nbsp;Australia. It&nbsp;holds enough water to&nbsp;cover the Earth under a&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;ft deep layer. Or, more usefully, it&nbsp;could provide enough water for thirsty Australians over the next 1,500&nbsp;years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/da3/7ab/d362b1501280eeb3156c490e04.png><p>Only&nbsp;6.5% of&nbsp;Australia has soil suitable for farming, so&nbsp;this doesn’t seem like a&nbsp;huge amount. But in&nbsp;case you forgot, Australia is&nbsp;BIG, and this small percentage is&nbsp;about the size of&nbsp;<a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a>! With this massive area available for farming, Australia has more than enough to&nbsp;feed its population, with a&nbsp;further&nbsp;70% of&nbsp;agricultural products that are exported overseas. So, with plenty of&nbsp;land, food, and water, why are the population figures so&nbsp;low?</p><p>A&nbsp;very slow migration process is&nbsp;the reason. First, only people from the United Kingdom lived here. Then, they opened their borders to&nbsp;other Europeans, and this restriction remained in&nbsp;place until 1973! You would think almost 200 years would be&nbsp;enough time for a&nbsp;lot more people to&nbsp;migrate, but Australia was just so&nbsp;far away. The risk of&nbsp;<a href=# title=traveling data-link=tag>traveling</a> such a&nbsp;long way and the costs of&nbsp;the journey meant that people from Europe preferred the shorter and cheaper options to&nbsp;migrate elsewhere, like Canada or&nbsp;the USA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/363/1d0/2a5f2751269bf67e92cfcff3a8.png><p>For the past 2,000&nbsp;years, people have understood that Earth is&nbsp;round. But did you know that it’s not a&nbsp;perfect sphere? Through the wobbly rotation of&nbsp;Earth, our planet constantly changes its size, very slowly, of&nbsp;course. The North and South poles are surprisingly flat. Earth is&nbsp;pretty much like a&nbsp;ball being squished.</p><p>Imagine there’s a&nbsp;giant hand with the fingers pressing at&nbsp;both poles. Because of&nbsp;this pressure, the equator pushes a&nbsp;little outwards. Along with an&nbsp;uneven gravitational field, Earth has loads of&nbsp;gravity glitches, some positive and others negative creating an&nbsp;uneven, rocky, and bumpy surface. Some places on&nbsp;Earth have more gravity than others. If&nbsp;you weighed yourself along the equator, you would weigh 0.5% less than at&nbsp;the poles. Not a&nbsp;whole lot, and definitely not worth the trip to&nbsp;change your weight!</p><p>If&nbsp;you were to&nbsp;measure the length from the center of&nbsp;the Earth towards the farthest point of&nbsp;Earth, you would be&nbsp;shocked that Mt. Everest isn’t at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;it. Instead, it’s along the equator, which is&nbsp;the pushed-out part. Ecuador’s mountain Chimborazo would actually be&nbsp;the tallest point on&nbsp;Earth as&nbsp;it’s the farthest from the center.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/676/8c4/8719565aea92882d83e3c2b770.png><p>We&nbsp;still have around&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;the Ocean to&nbsp;map, which is&nbsp;crazy considering how much of&nbsp;the solar system we’ve explored in&nbsp;comparison. But we&nbsp;are still aware of&nbsp;many of&nbsp;the unbelievable details about the Ocean. It&nbsp;covers over&nbsp;70% percent of&nbsp;the world’s surface, where&nbsp;94% of&nbsp;the Earth’s wildlife lives. And from some of&nbsp;the life in&nbsp;it, up&nbsp;to&nbsp;80% percent of&nbsp;the world’s oxygen is&nbsp;produced, mainly from plankton, algae, and bacteria.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the most famous already mapped places is&nbsp;the Mariana Trench. It’s the deepest point on&nbsp;Earth, as&nbsp;low as&nbsp;almost 7&nbsp;miles deep. That’s a&nbsp;huge 5&nbsp;times the length of&nbsp;the Grand Canyon and deeper than Mt. Everest is&nbsp;tall. It’s also home to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most ancient seabeds on&nbsp;Earth, casually laying low for about 180,000,000&nbsp;years! The pressure at&nbsp;the bottom is&nbsp;over 1,000&nbsp;bars, but although this is&nbsp;1,000 times more than normal pressure, life still flourishes here.</p><p>Throughout the Ocean, there are an&nbsp;estimated over 3,000,000 shipwrecks lying in&nbsp;the murky depths. Countless artifacts sit there untouched, and there could be&nbsp;more than all the world’s museums. The mid-ocean ridge is&nbsp;the longest in&nbsp;the world, reaching 40,000&nbsp;miles. That’s almost ten times the size of&nbsp;the Andes, the longest mountain range on&nbsp;land.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/719/e7c/2b9ee4524aba01340308fd122a.png><p>The <a href=# title=Sun data-link=tag>Sun</a> is&nbsp;the reason behind the blue and aqua colors of&nbsp;the Ocean. This color isn’t from the reflection of&nbsp;the sky, though they are both blue for the same reason. The surface of&nbsp;our planet receives white light from the Sun, and it&nbsp;absorbs the orange, red and yellow lights stronger. It&nbsp;doesn’t absorb the blue light so&nbsp;much, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;returns to&nbsp;how we&nbsp;see&nbsp;it. Of&nbsp;course, this only occurs based on&nbsp;how pure the water&nbsp;is. If&nbsp;the water is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;mud or&nbsp;algae, they scatter the light and overpower the water’s natural blueness.</p><p>There are many factors that determine what colors we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;our planet. Could you believe that the Earth wasn’t green before? Instead, it&nbsp;was purple! Chlorophyll in&nbsp;our atmosphere absorbs mainly blue and red wavelengths from the Sun and reflects the green ones to&nbsp;what we&nbsp;see our planet as&nbsp;today. Long ago, ancient microbes called “retinal” dominated the Earth instead of&nbsp;chlorophyll. They absorbed green light and reflected red and violet light.</p><p>Those microbes had a&nbsp;simpler structure, so&nbsp;they were easier to&nbsp;produce in&nbsp;the low-oxygen environment of&nbsp;the early Earth. They provided our planet with a&nbsp;purplish color instead of&nbsp;green. But chlorophyll is&nbsp;more efficient, and as&nbsp;the Earth was developing, it&nbsp;eventually took over. Imagine that billions of&nbsp;years ago, far-away observers could see our home as&nbsp;a&nbsp;small purple dot! I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;we&nbsp;could’ve also been purple? Probably not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8b3/e99/8ff3305e4e8f2c5db5f2eb37cf.png><p>The biggest tree on&nbsp;Earth is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Giant Sequoia named “General Sherman.” It&nbsp;stands over 280&nbsp;ft, almost reaching the height of&nbsp;a&nbsp;26-story building! They believe it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;2,700 years old, with a&nbsp;circumference of&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;inches. Its weight is&nbsp;a&nbsp;staggering 1,800&nbsp;tons. That’s heavy, but it&nbsp;isn’t even the heaviest living thing on&nbsp;Earth!</p><p>In&nbsp;Utah, a&nbsp;huge grove of&nbsp;trees called “Pando” works like a&nbsp;single colony of&nbsp;trees. The massive root system connects all of&nbsp;them together, with up&nbsp;to&nbsp;47,000&nbsp;stems. It&nbsp;weighs up&nbsp;to&nbsp;6,000 tons and is&nbsp;80,000 years old. It&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;the oldest living thing known to&nbsp;humans. Now, what about the biggest area of&nbsp;one being? Off the coast of&nbsp;Western Australia, seaweed grows to&nbsp;an&nbsp;unthinkable size.</p><p>The “Poseidon’s ribbon weed” has been growing for 4,500&nbsp;years, spreading underground clone shoots. It’s all connected and shares the same DNA with most of&nbsp;its shoots. It&nbsp;covers a&nbsp;massive 77&nbsp;square miles, the same size as&nbsp;28,000 soccer fields, or&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;Nebraska! And it&nbsp;won’t stop there either, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;grow by&nbsp;2&nbsp;feet each year. It’s hard to&nbsp;even picture the scale of&nbsp;these enormous beings. Now, just imagine if&nbsp;they were all purple!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLuwrs6dsGakmauytHnIp2StoJViuqqww6WcZqeWYq62v9OrmKWhkWKur7CMsqauZaekwq2wza1kcWlkZoR5ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
