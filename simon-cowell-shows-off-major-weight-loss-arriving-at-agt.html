The 61-year-old is back in the spotlight and looking better than ever. He was pictured walking on set of ‘AGT’ with a suit in his hand. Simon showed off a noticeably slimmed-down figure since recovering from his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">electric bike accident.</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CNBGcaghgXD/</p>Instagram.com/agt</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-s-weight-loss-is-on-full-display-on-agt-set>Simon Cowell’s Weight Loss Is On Full Display On ‘AGT’ Set</h2><p>Simon gave the cameras a big thumbs up and flashed a subtle smile walking on to the ‘AGT’ set. This is the first time he is back on the show since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>breaking his back</a> and undergoing a six-hour surgery. He missed out on the live shows last season along with the live shows on ‘BGT’ after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the horrific accident.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>One thing that is evident in these photos is that Simon is looking lean and in shape. Simon has lost over 20lbs according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> due to his vegan diet. However, Simon previously ditched his vegan diet while recovering from the accident to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>“rebuild his strength.”</a></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIMON COWELL’S POSSIBLE PLANS FOR SHARON OSBOURNE AND PIERS MORGAN</a></strong></p><p>Simon’s girlfriend Lauren Silverman <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brought some of his favorite foods</a> to the hospital after his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>bike accident</a> including Italian bean soup and cottage pie with turkey. Back in May 2020, Simon spoke to his ex-girlfriend Terri Seymour about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">losing 60lbs.</a> Regardless of what diet Simon is following now, he looks great!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3FXDiWley4&t=64s</p></figure><p>During a 2019 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Simon spoke about his decision to get healthy. “I went to see this doctor in London. We did some tests” Simon said. “And then a month later he said, ‘You have the worst diet I’ve ever met from any patient.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“It’s like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Eric diet </a>because he actually, apart from ice cream, he actually likes water. I mean, who likes water? And his raw vegetables. So I’m on like, the Eric Cowell diet” Simon joked about his 7-year-old son.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-is-gearing-up-for-the-summer-premiere-of-the-hit-nbc-show>Simon Is Gearing Up For The Summer Premiere Of The Hit NBC Show</h3><p>Walking onto the set, Simon wore a long sleeve grey shirt with his signature white shorts. He kept it super casual in a pair of black sneakers since we are all so used to seeing him wear dress shoes. Simon joined his fellow ‘AGT’ judges Howie Mandel, Sofia Vergara and Heidi Klum backstage to snap some pictures before searching for the best talent in the world. The judges all have a very special bond.</p><p>“I’ve got to be honest with you, it wasn’t that bad actually&nbsp;breaking your back,” Simon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told People Magazine</a> last month. “I mean it wasn’t great for 3-4 weeks but after that you get through it. I had to do so much exercise now. I actually feel better than I did before <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the accident</a>.”</p><p>“For me I had nightmares, it was heartbreaking to me not to have Simon my first season,” Sofia joked in a Zoom interview. “I thought I needed him to back me up and teach me, to guide me. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, I lost like 6 lbs., I cried myself to sleep.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIMON COWELL IS READY TO MAKE A COMEBACK ON TV —&nbsp;LOOKING FITTER THAN EVER</a></strong></p><p>Well, fans have certainly missed seeing Simon on ‘AGT’ and are so happy that he is back.
