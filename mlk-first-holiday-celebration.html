The first year the U.S. observed the holiday was 1986, when the day fell on Jan. 20.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That Monday, people across the country held marches and church services to celebrate King’s legacy, as shown by this 1986 <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC News report</a>. In California, a freedom train ran from San Jose to San Francisco to honor King, while thousands marched in Birmingham, Ala.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Step Into History: Learn how to experience the 1963 March on Washington in virtual reality</a></i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As <a href=#>TIME reported</a> in January of 1986, the candlelight vigils, concerts, readings, teach-ins and religious services held throughout the country served as “occasions to recall one of the most painful and dramatic eras of American history.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There is a heightened awareness of him that was not present before the holiday,” King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, told TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">King’s <a href=# rel=noopener>hometown</a> of Atlanta, Ga., was the stage for big celebrations—visitors from all corners of the U.S. traveled to march in a parade along with civil rights leaders and King’s family. George H.W. Bush, vice president at the time, joined Coretta Scott King to place a wreath on King’s tomb and for a ceremony at <a href=# rel=noopener>Ebenezer Baptist Church</a>, where King served as co-pastor until his death. During the ceremony, Coretta Scott King awarded <a href=#>Desmond Tutu</a> with the King Peace Prize for his work against Apartheid.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But not every part of that day in 1986 was a celebration of King’s legacy: as the <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC report</a> noted, some places were openly hostile to the holiday. In Buffalo, N.Y., a sculpture of King was whitewashed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And the road to a national commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. was not yet complete: At the time the federal bill took effect, not every state observed the holiday. For example, House Republicans from Arizona, including Sen. John McCain, had <a href=#>voted against the bill</a> in 1983, and the state only voted in favor of recognizing the holiday in 1992. In 2000, South Carolina <a href=#>became the last state</a> to sign a bill recognizing MLK Day as a paid holiday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbmNngHh%2FjqajpGWWnr%2B0wIyhpqWhlJbGbq%2FEpZybqpGptrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
