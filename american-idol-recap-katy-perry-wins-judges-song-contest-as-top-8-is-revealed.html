This episode marked the return of the Judge’s Song Contest, as the panel chose songs for each of the singers. At the end of the night, Katy Perry was the contest winner. She chose to save Oliver Steele, who rounded out the Top 8.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katy-perry-wins-american-idol-judge-s-song-contest>Katy Perry Wins American Idol Judge’s Song Contest</h2><p>The three judges all suggested a song for each of the singers to perform. The singer got to choose their favorite, and the judge with the most chosen songs was the winner. At the end of the night, four of the singers chose Katy Perry’s suggested songs, making her the winner.</p><p>Notably, Oliver Steele correctly guessed which of his suggested songs was chosen by which judge. Because two of the songs were by Perry’s ex John Mayer, Oliver correctly concluded that she had chosen the third option, “High and Dry” by Radiohead. Not only that, but he knew which Mayer song was chosen by which of the two other judges.</p><p>Perry praised Oliver’s performance as “so angelic” and “like nothing you have done before.” At the end of the episode, Oliver was in the bottom three. As the Judge’s Song Contest winner, Perry chose to save him from elimination.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AMERICAN IDOL’ WINNER CHAYCE BECKHAM RELEASES NEW SONG ‘TILL THE DAY I DIE’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G9gtmCZwDI</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-top-8-revealed-after-america-s-vote>Top 8 Revealed After America’s Vote</h3><p>After America’s vote and Perry’s save, the Top 8 was revealed to be Megan Danielle, Haven Madison, Warren Peay, Wé Ani, Colin Stough, Iam Tongi, Zachariah Smith, and Oliver Steele.</p><p>Standout performances from Monday’s show included Wé Ani’s powerhouse rendition of “I Have Nothing” by Whitney Houston, chosen by Luke Bryan. He called it “one of the most elegant things I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Later, Megan Danielle delivered a meaningful performance of “Go Rest High on That Mountain” by Vince Gill, also chosen by Bryan. Unbeknownst to the judges, it was the song Megan sang at her grandfather’s funeral.</p><p>Along with Oliver Steele, Marybeth Byrd and Tyson Venegas were in the bottom three after America’s vote. They didn’t earn Perry’s save, so they were both eliminated. It was a shame to see them go, as they both delivered impressive and emotional performances on Monday night.</p><p>Tyson’s elimination also means that there are no longer any Platinum Ticket winners left in the competition. It just goes to show that the honor doesn’t guarantee success in the competition.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-next-week-s-guest-judges-revealed>Next Week’s Guest Judges Revealed</h3><p>Monday’s episode also featured an exciting announcement about next Sunday night’s show. Because Katy Perry and Lionel Richie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">will be performing</a> at King Charles’ coronation concert in the UK, Alanis Morissette and Ed Sheeran will be filling in on the panel.</p><p>The Top 8 will also be taking the stage to sing both of the guest judges’ songs. They’ll deliver solo performances of Morissette’s discography, while teaming up for duets of Sheeran’s tracks.</p><p>On Monday night, Season 19 winner Chayce Beckham also made an appearance to sing his new single “Till the Day I Die.” The show even surprised him with the news that his song “23” is now certified gold. Luke Bryan presented him with the plaque.</p><p>Do you agree with the results of Monday’s episode? Did you favorite make it into the Top 8?
