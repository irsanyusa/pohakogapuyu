Bindi Irwin, Season 21</h3><p>Since season 21 kicked off, numerous fans were already rooting for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bindi Irwin</a>, and it’s not difficult to understand why. As the daughter of the late legendary conservationist Steve Irwin, she happened to be gifted in the ballroom. Her talent brought her far from week one to the last.

Jordan Fisher, Season 25</h3><p>Given his previous and compelling experience in dance and live theater, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Fisher</a>’s triumph might be controversial for some. Nonetheless, if we’re setting quality of performance as criteria, he is undeniably the victor. From his very first dance in the ballroom, Fisher proved that he deserved to win, and all we can do is agree.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-charli-d-amelio-season-31>8. Charli D’Amelio, Season 31</h3><p>When fans found out that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charli D’Amelio</a> would join the show, reactions were mixed. The TikTok sensation received a huge amount of criticism for having a competitive amount of dance training as a kid. Nonetheless, D’Amelio was every inch a frontrunner in season 31. Coupling her technical excellence with her captivating charisma, it’s no wonder she was hailed the winner of the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-apolo-anton-ohno-season-4>7.

She’s fabulously performed intricate dance routines per week, and that’s despite her uncompromising knee pain since day one.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-rumer-willis-season-20>4.

There’s no denying —her showdown against musician Riker Lynch remains the most tensioned battle for victory in the history of DWTS.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-alfonso-ribeiro-season-19>3.
