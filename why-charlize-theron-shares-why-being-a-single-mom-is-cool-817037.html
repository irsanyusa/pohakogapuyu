During a&nbsp;heartfelt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, the actress shared that <strong>adoption had always been a&nbsp;top priority for her, and she couldn’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;while she was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>.</strong><br>Her upbringing deeply influenced this decision in&nbsp;<a href=# title="South Africa" data-link=tag>South Africa</a>, where she was exposed to&nbsp;the harsh realities faced by&nbsp;orphaned children, igniting a&nbsp;lifelong commitment to&nbsp;providing a&nbsp;loving home for those in&nbsp;need.</p><p><h2>She wants her daughter to&nbsp;understand their identity first.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d62/a93/5d1fc45d9aa9459a4e0a13dc54.jpg><p>Sam Sharma, PacificCoastNews/EAST NEWS</p><p>Theron’s transparent and thoughtful <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>approach</a> to&nbsp;parenting extends beyond the decision to&nbsp;adopt. The Oscar-winning actress has been vocal about raising two daughters, emphasizing the importance of&nbsp;instilling confidence and pride in&nbsp;their heritage.

Filing for adoption in&nbsp;any country that allowed a&nbsp;single woman to&nbsp;adopt, Theron serendipitously found that both her daughters were born in&nbsp;the United States and shared African American heritage. Theron emphasized the significance of&nbsp;embracing diverse family structures and challenging traditional norms, advocating passionately for the acceptance and celebration of&nbsp;single parents.<br>“Everything that&nbsp;I hoped would happen during my&nbsp;adoption process did happen because <strong>these two babies were meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life</strong>&nbsp;— and they’re my&nbsp;children.”</p><p>Addressing a&nbsp;more challenging aspect of&nbsp;her daughter Jackson’s experience, Theron <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opened</a> up&nbsp;about the incorrect pronouns used in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=media data-link=tag>media</a>, detailing the emotional toll it&nbsp;took on&nbsp;her child.

Reflecting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;2020 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>podcast</a> episode with Diane von Furstenberg, Charlize Theron shared a&nbsp;heartwarming moment when her daughter August suggested she needed a&nbsp;boyfriend. Theron smiled, telling August, “Actually, I&nbsp;don’t. Right now, I&nbsp;feel really good. <strong>I’m in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship with myself</strong>.”<br>Theron is&nbsp;determined to&nbsp;shape a&nbsp;new narrative for young girls, encouraging them to&nbsp;embrace the idea of&nbsp;being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship with themselves. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;society that often imposes predefined norms, Theron aims to&nbsp;break the stereotype that not being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship doesn’t equate to&nbsp;failure. Her inspiring goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;raise a&nbsp;generation of&nbsp;young girls who recognize the beauty and strength of&nbsp;self-love and independence.</p><p>In&nbsp;essence, Charlize Theron’s odyssey into <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>motherhood</a> goes far beyond the glamorous façade of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>.
