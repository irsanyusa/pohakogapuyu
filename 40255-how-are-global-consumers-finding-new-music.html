But video games, commercials, and social media are crucial in capturing the attention of the world’s young consumers.</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>Overall, among consumers in 17 markets in which YouGov conducted research, music apps such as Spotify are the most </span>popular way to discover new tunes (36%) as more consumers migrate to streaming apps.</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>Our data also shows that radio </span>isn’t dead. A third of global consumers still find recent music on terrestrial or satellite radio (33%); however this group is more likely to be over 35 years old.</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>Social media is also a powerful platform for artists, as 32% of consume</span>rs say that is where they find new music. Consumers 18-24 (50%) and 25-34 (43%) are especially likely to find artists they like on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>Friends and family play an important role in new music discovery among consumers around the world (27%) and among all age groups, though </span>particularly among the younger 18-24 demographic (35%).</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>Movie and television soundtracks are also crucial for new music releases. Much like</span> personal recommendations, roughly a quarter of consumers say they’ve added to their music catalogue thanks for films or shows, and again young adults 18-24 are overrepresented (34%).</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>While commercials (13%), websites (13%)</span> and video games (9%) appear lower on our list, it’s important to note that consumers between the ages of 18 and 34 are significantly more likely to find new music through these channels.</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>One in five consumers</span> worldwide between 18-24 has found music via a video game, which is a testament to the importance of soundtracks and scores in video games.

In the US, radio remains king (33%), ahead of music apps (25%) and personal recommendations from friends or family (25%). Similar results come out of Europe, where radio reigns supreme (40%), ahead of apps (33%) and recommendations (25%).</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>I</span>n Asia, however, social media (45%) and music apps (45%) are the most popular avenues for finding fresh tunes. In Mexico, social media platforms and music apps also play an outsized role in new music discovery, just as they do in the United Arab Emirates.</p><p><strong><span data-contrast=auto>Receive monthly topical insights about the Leisure and entertainment industry, straight to your inbox. </span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span data-contrast=none><span data-ccp-charstyle=Hyperlink>Sign up today</span></span></a><span data-contrast=auto>.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span data-contrast=auto>Discover more </span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span data-contrast=none><span data-ccp-charstyle=Hyperlink>leisure and entertainment content</span></span></a><span data-contrast=auto> here</span></strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span data-contrast=none><span data-ccp-charstyle=Hyperlink>Want to run your own research?
