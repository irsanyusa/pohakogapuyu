The pop icon is obviously in bliss with the current status of his relationship and such is expected to reflect in his upcoming music.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Bolton Talks Romance with Girlfriend Heather Kerzner</h2><p>With a songwriting career founded on romance, an organic and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy</a> love life is definitely favorable for Bolton. Luckily, his intimacy with Kerzner is intense enough to positively influence his creative process.</p><p>“It’s been very natural — a kind of checking all the boxes,” he said. “My work takes up a lot of space, and I’ve been learning what the whole process is of having someone who really brightens up your life.”&nbsp;</p><p>Back in February, Bolton and Kerzner officially made their red carpet debut as a romantic pair. According to the “Go The Distance” singer, he and Kerzner have known each other for 15 years. For all wondering, there is a 16 year age difference between the couple. Bolton is currently 70 years old, and it is believed that Kerzner is 54 years old — in 2017 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daily Mail reported</a> that Kerzner was 48 years old.</p><p>Despite their longtime friendship, they only began their romance last summer. Yet, he hinted about their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">relationship</a> amid the red carpet moment then, Bolton refused to speak more about the same. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that&nbsp; “the people I love bring me a lot of happiness.”</p><p>Bolton and Kerzner are not each other’s first shot at love. The singer was divorced from Maureen McGuire with whom he shares three daughters. He was then engaged to actress Nicollette Sheridan.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Kerzner previously married casino mogul Sol Kerzner. After they separated in 2011, she shared a romance with and got engaged to businessman James Henderson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-new-album-spark-of-light-aims-to-inspire-people>His New Album Spark of Light Aims to Inspire People</h2><p>The Grammy-winning singer began writing songs for Spark of Light during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amid the artistic process, he made it his goal to create something beautiful to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">help people through music</a>.</p><p>“We were basically observing our friends and family and seeing that they all really needed some light, that it was so dark and oppressive and basically we were all just carrying layers of fear to our every day,” Bolton said. “And so we started to feel a sense of responsibility to deliver hope and promise and all these feelings that seem to be so elusive, and it started to become a feel-good record.”</p><p>Dropped on July 14, Spark of Light kicks off with its sensational title track and ends with the moving track “Out of the Ashes.” Some of the songs included are “Beautiful World,” “Whatever She Wants,” and “Just The Beginning.”</p><p>With the release of his latest album, Bolton has not only revitalized his vocals but also successfully made an original collection after 14 years. Spark of Light has further become special as the singer also celebrates his 50th year of creating music.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_LionelRichie_ABC_Stewart-Cook-220x147.jpg alt="Lionel Richie Reveals Origin Story of His Signature Mustache" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>michael bolton</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zKKaoZmVoXqju8utpqdll5rBtHnCmqWdoZRirqO71K1kq6edlruksYywoK2gXaOyuHnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKKrrGWSmrKvedWeqbJlnpbBtr7ApWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
