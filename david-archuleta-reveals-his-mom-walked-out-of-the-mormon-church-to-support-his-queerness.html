Fortunately, the journey became bearable as he now has the entire support of his mother who looked away from religion to back him up.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>David Archuleta Says His Mom Didn’t Immediately Accept He’s Gay</h2><p>Amid attending the 2023 Project Angel Food’s Lead with Love 4 fundraising event, Archuleta took the time to talk about his mother, Lupe Marie Mayorga, and his relationship with her after he revealed that he’s part of the LGBTQIA+ community. The “Crush” hitmaker said that his mom was initially reluctant in accepting his queer identity.</p><p>“At first, she said, ‘DA, I love you, but I love God more. And marriage is between a man and a woman.’ And I’m like, ‘Mom, I understand.’ Because that’s what I believed up until a month before coming out,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>. “And I said, ‘Mom, I don’t need you to accept everything about my journey immediately. I just want you to be willing to walk along with me in this journey to learn alongside me.'”</p><p>Back in November 2022, Archuleta confirmed he had left the Mormon church after a “faith crisis.” Such decision has apparently convinced his mom to do the same in a genuine effort to embrace him and his queerness.</p><p>“My mom said, ‘I’m going to step away from the church.’ And I was like, ‘What?’ And she just said, ‘If you’re going to hell, we’re all going to hell together,'” he said. “… She just kind of said it in a funny way.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Archuleta</a>, his mom has reached the point where she doesn’t want to abandon family just to please religion. For her, following God and accepting her son are not at all mutually exclusive.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-set-to-release-new-single-i-m-yours>He’s Set to Release New Single “I’m Yours”</h2><p>On Friday, June 30, the “A Little Too Not Over You” singer will be releasing a new single, “I’m Yours.” This song comes after his latest drop <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Up.</a>“</p><p>“If you want it come and get it, I’m yours. My new <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">song</a> #ImYours drops next Friday!” he wrote.</p><p>Archuleta created the song in hopes of making people dance. The singer has recently released a short video poster of the single, showing a double cherry in a plain turquoise background.</p><p>“It’s just about saying, ‘I’m happy where I am and this is going to feel good.'” he said. “So that’ll be fun to just show a fun, happy, dancey side. I don’t think I’ve shown that in a long time, if ever.”</p><p>Fans are definitely excited to hear the full studio version of the single. With its lively tune, “I’m Yours” will perhaps be one of the newest club songs people will love.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AlterEgo_Ep111-GG_00950.jpeg alt="‘Alter Ego’ Winner Jake Thomsen Releases Highly Anticipated Single ‘The Room’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>David Archuleta</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qtopxdlr%2BktNSlnK2ZXaeyt7HApapmoJmoeq67zGaumqSbmrFuu9StZKieXam1pnnMqKmmp55isKnB0ZyfZqyfYsC2vM%2Boqa1lmJ7Abr3UnpyrppWowHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
