As of 2021, Mimi Faust age is 49 years.</p><h3>How tall is she?</h3><p class=align-left>Mimi Faust height is 5 feet 8 inches, which is 173 centimetres.</p><h3>Childhood years</h3><p class=align-left>Her mother’s name was Gloria Eva Simmons. After the wedding, she added James at the end.</p><p class=align-left>Later, she changed her name to Olaiya Odufunke. When her youngest child was 6 years old, Olaiya became obsessed with Scientology and sold her entire property.</p><p class=align-left>After the woman joined the <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sea Organization</a></i> she left her older children and life in Atlanta behind. The future VH1's star was too young to be left.</p><p class=align-left>Thus, her mother took the girl to the head office of Scientology in Los Angeles:</p>That’s what she wanted to do. She didn’t care what we thought about it.<p class=align-left>She had a troubled and unconventional childhood:</p>Life was completely turned upside down. We lived in a room with bunk beds. We went to the cafeteria for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And my mom was working all the time. I only got to see her during what they called Family Time, from five to seven pm. Just two hours a day.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b1628276db685d10.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Aaron Hernandez daughter Avielle Janelle Hernandez?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Considering that Scientologists' children were recruited for the <i>Sea Organization</i> at a very early age, Olaiya’s daughter was no exception.</p><p class=align-left>When she was 13, church officials told her she needed to work for them:</p>I was eating their food and staying in their facility. They told me I either needed to sign a billion-year contract or I had to leave.<p class=align-left>So she packed her suitcases and went to the house of her friend:</p>She was a friend but I called her my cousin. I went to her place… I was still going to a Scientology school. It was the middle of the school year. After staying with my cousin over the weekend, I had to catch a bus back to the school on Monday.<h3>Education</h3><p class=align-left>She attended the Mace-Kingsley school at Silver Lake, established by two Scientologists. Her education was a challenge since she had no home to sleep at:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7a946d60db5fe4f0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gloria Govan bio: age, sister, ex-husband, partner, children</span></p></a>These weren’t just Sea Org kids. There were children of rich Scientologists there too. So I’d ask if I could spend the night with a different schoolmate every day, and I’d go home with them. No one knew I didn’t have a home of my own. I finished the school year that way.<h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Upon graduation, she worked in her cousin’s pharmacy. When she was 17 years old, her mother asked her to come to see her at the <i>Sea Organization</i>.</p><p class=align-left>It was a trick that the church authorities used to recruit her. Nonetheless, their plan was a failure as she refused to sign their contract.</p><p class=align-left>In the late 1990s, she starred in music videos of Kelly Price (<i>It’s Gonna Rain</i>) and Pharrell Williams (<i>Frontin</i>, with Jay-Z).</p><p class=align-left>In 2002, she launched her cleaning business named <i>Keep It Clean Inc</i>.
