This fast-bonding product can be used to fix numerous things, including plastic, metal, wood, glass, and numerous other materials. However, for all its versatility, it can also be quite a pain when it sticks to surfaces one never intended. In such a scenario, figuring out how to remove super glue from different surfaces becomes essential.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d689c907897d9901.jpg><p class=align-left>Once super glue has dried, it becomes considerably resistant to moisture and temperature, making its removal all the more complicated.</p><h2>How to remove super glue from different surfaces</h2><p class=align-left>Here is a look at some simple ways to get rid of superglue from glass, wood, plastic, metal, and fabric.</p><h3>How to remove super glue from plastic</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dd217074cd73e45b.jpg><p class=align-left>Here are some products and tools one can use to remove super glue from plastic surfaces.</p><h4>Acetone</h4><p class=align-left>You can hardly come across a super glue removal tutorial that does not mention acetone. This colourless solvent works wonders at lifting super glue residue from plastic surfaces. To use acetone, moisten the affected surface using a damp cloth, then dab it with a cotton ball dipped in acetone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ef2ff648b347640.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to clean a mousepad at home properly without ruining it</span></p></a><h4>Soapy water</h4><p class=align-left>Mix some dishwashing soap with warm water to make a soapy solution. Dip a clean piece of cloth into the solution, wring it thoroughly and then place it on the super glue stain. Wrap the cloth in plastic and let it sit on the stain for about three hours, after which you can remove and clean the surface with more soapy water.</p><h4>Rubbing alcohol</h4><p class=align-left>Also known as isopropyl, rubbing alcohol is known to break down dried superglue over time. Soak a soft cloth in warm water and place it on the stained surface for thirty minutes. Next, wet a cotton ball with isopropyl and gently clean the stained area until the superglue lifts off.</p><h4>Razor blade</h4><p class=align-left>If you are looking for a more hands-on approach to superglue removal, you can always scrape off the stain from the plastic surface. To do this, use the edge of a razor blade to raise the glue stain's edges gently. Chip away at the stain gradually until it is all gone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1d2752b54df4b70d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get slime out of clothes, carpet, hair and other surfaces: Top methods</span></p></a><h4>Sandpaper</h4><p class=align-left>Sandpaper is another versatile, <a href=#>easily available product</a> you can use to get rid of super glue stains. When using sandpaper, take care not to scratch the plastic surface beneath the dried super glue stain. Slide the sandpaper atop the stain gently until none is left.</p><h4>Vegetable oil and baking soda</h4><p class=align-left>Mix equal parts of oil and baking soda and pour the resulting mixture onto the stained area. Allow the paste to sit for 15 minutes before scrubbing the spot gently. Do this until all the glue residue is gone. For stubborn stains, feel free to repeat the process several times.</p><h3>How to remove super glue from metal</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ef2ff648b347640.jpg><p class=align-left>Due to its fast-bonding nature, super glue can easily stick onto metallic surfaces. Here are products you can use to get rid of super glue stains on metallic surfaces.</p><h4>Acetone</h4><p class=align-left>Metallic surfaces are quite tolerant to acetone. If you do not have pure acetone at your disposal, feel free to use nail polish remover â€“ most brands have acetone as one of the ingredients. Soak a piece of cloth or cotton ball in acetone and dab it gently on the stain until the glue dissolves.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2e66be008f3ae79e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Activated carbon face mask: a step-by-step recipe</span></p></a><h4>Plastic spatula</h4><p class=align-left>If the super glue stain is on a flat metallic surface, you can try scraping it off using a plastic spatula. When doing this, take care not to scratch the metal surface beneath the stain. For stubborn stains, try softening the glue using a cleaning solution before scraping it off.</p><h4>Hydrogen peroxide</h4><p class=align-left>Soak a cotton ball in hydrogen peroxide and press it against the affected area. The superglue stain will gradually soften and can then be wiped away easily.</p><h3>How to remove super glue from glass</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1d2752b54df4b70d.png><p class=align-left>Here are some products that can be used to remove super glue stains from glass surfaces.</p><h4>Nail polish remover</h4><p class=align-left>It is worth noting that nail polish remover is only safe for use on pure glass. Surfaces made of polycarbonate or other materials resembling glass can be easily damaged by the acetone found in nail polish remover.</p><p class=align-left>Soak a cotton swap in polish remover and then rub the affected surface gently until all the adhesive residue is gone. Keep in mind that the process might take a while, so patience is key.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8d72809f940e19de.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top tips on how to make slime without glue or borax</span></p></a><h4>Isopropyl</h4><p class=align-left>Rubbing alcohol can be used to remove super glue from glass surfaces. Before using it, ensure the glass does not have additional coatings susceptible to damage from the use of rubbing alcohol. Saturate a cotton ball with isopropyl and rub the stained area until the glue comes off.</p><h4>Essential oils</h4><p class=align-left>Tea tree oil, <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1193333-coconut-oil-skin-whitening-work.html href=#>coconut oil</a>, and eucalyptus oil are all quite effective at lifting off super glue residue. Before using any of <a href=#>the oils</a>, though, test them on a small surface to ensure there will be no resultant damage on the glass surface. Apply a few drops onto the affected surface and rub gently using a piece of cloth.</p><p class=align-left>Once the oil saturates the hardened glue, the stain comes off gradually.</p><h3>How to remove super glue from fabric</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3a6104976b4edbd0.jpg><p class=align-left>When working with superglue, it is quite easy to get some on your clothes accidentally.
