Masturbation is not mentioned in the Bible as a sin, but it could be inferred. Some Christians believe that masturbation is a sin, others disagree, but what about sex with sex toys?</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>Bimbo</h2></p><p>"Why would a single person use it? Let's say it is to 'relieve sexual stress or tension' seeing 'actual intercourse' is not permitted to or expected of a single person, Abi? Isn't that technically wrong?"</p><p>"But a married person is legally and religiously free to relieve the sexual stress through the partner, so why would such a one need it, right?"</p><p>"What if, say, one of the spouses contracts an irreversible and/or permanent libido reduction, in which case the partner becomes asexual?"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Or where long-term, long-distance occurs in the marriage relationship? Or where there is erectile dysfunction? Can one use it then?"</p><p>Bimbo does not have the answers, but he feels that it is a moral dilemma whether masturbating while married is a sin.</p><p>My next respondent's Blessing answers the questions posed by Bimbo.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>Blessing</h2></p><p>Blessing thinks solo use of sex toys as a married person is a form of lust and it is a sin.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"From what I know it is indirectly a sin. Because I believe when people masturbate, they usually think of someone, and the Bible is clear on its position on lust."</p><p>Secondly, if you are married and you use sex toys without a partner, you might be thinking of someone else and that is a form of cheating.</p><p>“But I don't know if it is possible to use a sex toy without thinking of a real person. Is she thinking of her husband? Highly unlikely. I mean it is most likely because he is not good enough that why she needs augmentation, so she would not be thinking about him...most likely."</p><p>" I am almost certain she would be thinking of somebody else...but what do I know?"</p><p>Interesting response from Blessing, but is it okay if she is thinking of her husband when using sex toys?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>Funmi</h2></p><p>“The Bible was written in ancient times, but we can infer that is it a sin because Proverbs 5:18 says to rejoice in the wife of your youth and using sex toys shows a lack of contentment with your wife.”</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-22>Sola</h2></p><p>Masturbation is a sin. Sola declares, “but if you use sex toys with your spouse, it is not a sin. God does not concern himself with how you have sex and what you do in the bedroom."</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-24>Katherine</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I will not be using sex toys when married, it doesn’t just feel right to me."</p><p>Their sinfulness are context specific. For Christians it only seems right if your partner is involved and not as a way to masturbate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7wKucZquVrXq1u9isZKyhnpvCrXmUZpqhqpmowaqtzaxkrZmcoHqirs6uq2asmJ7AcL%2FTrZ6kqKc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
