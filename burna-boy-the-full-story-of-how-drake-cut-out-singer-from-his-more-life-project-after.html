Burna Boy entertained friends, colleagues and family members, and in a rare moment of truth he explained what happened between him and Drake.</p><p>Turns out Burna Boy and Drake had met in London, where they connected and decided to make records for a new project that the OVO boss was working on. That project required was designed to be an inclusive one, which would contain different genres of music from all over the world.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For his part on the project, Burna Boy set to work, record plenty of music for the project. He worked hard, delivering 5 singles for the work.</p><p>“I worked on 5 new songs for the project, and submitted them all,” Burna Boy said.</p><p>The singer explained that after recording, he submitted the songs to Drake and his team, who chose only one of the songs named “More Life.” He received confirmation that they were going to use the record as a part of the project, but when the record came out, it was a completely different form entirely.</p><p>Turns out Drake’s entire project was named “More Life,” the same title of Burna’s song. But that wasn’t the most disappointing part. Burna Boy was not officially named or credited on the project which peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 200 album chart, and broke several streaming charts.</p><p>For Burna Boy, he did appear on the outro of the song ‘Get it together’, which was a remake of South African DJ, <strong>Black Coffee</strong>, and <strong>Bucie</strong>’s 2010 single <a href=# id=0206e235-288f-5bfa-b5e0-584390e25bdf>‘Superman’.</a> The new version had UK singer <strong>Jorja Smith</strong>, singing about fixing a strained relationship. Burna Boy’s ‘More life’ was chopped beyond recognition, and sampled at the outro of the record in an almost unrecognisable form.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“They told me they had picked it, but when the song came out it was…chopped..” Burna Boy said.</p><p>Burna didn’t receive writing or production credits on “More Life,” and has so far refused to speak or acknowledge his contribution to the project. The only time he did confirm that he was part of it was when a fan asked him for clarity on Twitter.</p><p>“Yes,” Burna responded to a question.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Drake had done this. For the album “Views,” he cut out Caribbean singer <strong>Popcaan</strong> from the song ‘Controlla’, while also altering Wizkid’s contribution on ‘One Dance’ with a phone-in effect. His recent single, ‘God’s plan’, also had another rapper, <strong>Trippie Red</strong> removed from it. In December 2017, Drake shared photos and a video of him and <strong>Tekno</strong> working together on a new project. That project is yet to be released.</p><p>Burna Boy isn’t letting that get to him though. According to the singer, the song “More Life” is a jam, and he has repurposed it, and included it on his forthcoming album, “Outside”. The project drops on Friday, January 26, 2018.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>: Burna Boy has postponed his album lsitening by a week. "Outside" album will be released on Friday, February 2, 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2Svtr7NmmSbp6liwamxjJ%2BspaRdqMGwvthmpp9lmKTEbrDRmqKeZZOqwW671K1krKGenLKzecWrpqZlmJ7AbrnOq5xmpJmbsm680aihnpukYq6nwMSrZp2ylWa5sa8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
