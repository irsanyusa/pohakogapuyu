In&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;identical twins, they even share the same face! Although sometimes it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;frustrating to&nbsp;be&nbsp;known more as&nbsp;twins, than as&nbsp;separate individuals. In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recent years</a>, the number of&nbsp;twins being birthed has increased with 33.9 babies out of&nbsp;1,000 having a&nbsp;twin in&nbsp;2014. Being a&nbsp;twin means you come with a&nbsp;built-in best friend, which is&nbsp;just one of&nbsp;the reasons why the relationship between twins is&nbsp;something others can only envy.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> look into why siblings born on&nbsp;the same day share a&nbsp;very special kind of&nbsp;bond.</p><p><h2>“Twintuition” is&nbsp;a&nbsp;thing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cc9/766/082c5c52818e1028dca5c3440d.png><p>While there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;evidence that people who’ve shared their mother’s womb with another person have an&nbsp;intuition about each other, there have been a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;claims that they have a&nbsp;sixth sense when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;their twin. For <a href=#>example</a>, when a&nbsp;woman fell down the stairs and injured her knee, her womb sister felt a&nbsp;terrible pain in&nbsp;the same leg, at&nbsp;the same time, even though she was halfway across the world.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>survey</a> on&nbsp;twins, when asked if&nbsp;they had “the ability to&nbsp;know what was happening to&nbsp;their partner” nearly&nbsp;40% answered “yes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce4/aa5/f1392554f58032659d503053d6.jpg><p>This telepathy goes beyond the physical too. The <a href=#>Jim twins</a>, who were separated at&nbsp;birth and reconnected with each other at&nbsp;age&nbsp;39, found that they have lots of&nbsp;similarities. Both of&nbsp;them were coincidentally named Jim by&nbsp;their adoptive parents, had dogs named Toy, married a&nbsp;Linda before divorcing and having a&nbsp;Betty as&nbsp;their second wife. They’d both also served as&nbsp;part-time sheriffs and enjoyed home carpentry projects.</p><p><h2>They are “a&nbsp;family within a&nbsp;family.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/308/4b2/a6bfd950f59d756f228e86be7f.png><p>Since they came from the same place at&nbsp;about the same time, they’re likely to&nbsp;end up&nbsp;being each other’s best friend, especially if&nbsp;they grow up&nbsp;together. This set of&nbsp;siblings shares a&nbsp;different world together, than the one they have with other family members. So&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that about&nbsp;40% actually have their own languages, <a href=#>says</a> one study.</p><p><h2>Same faces means they can swap places.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c03/8a8/79572558dcb422c05fa289c51a.jpg><p>For those with identical faces, they have another special connection because the joke is&nbsp;always on&nbsp;other people. Most people would not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;tell them apart and only they know which one is&nbsp;which. They could pull a&nbsp;prank on&nbsp;their parents and teachers or&nbsp;stand in&nbsp;place of&nbsp;their other half if&nbsp;the need arises. This is&nbsp;exactly what Rami Malek <a href=#>did</a>, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;once swapped places with his twin Sami to&nbsp;help him with a&nbsp;monologue in&nbsp;college.</p><p><h2>They live longer than others.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4c/35d/acaf4b50ff8ba966c7d67f1cdc.jpg><p>Although twins might be&nbsp;at&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>higher risk</a> of&nbsp;dying during pregnancy or&nbsp;shortly after birth, the mortality rate has declined over the past 30&nbsp;years. Interestingly, another study <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> that identical pairs live longer than fraternal ones, who live longer than the general population. Male identical pairs are likely to&nbsp;live longest. The <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a> benefits might be&nbsp;because they have someone socially close who can support and protect them.</p><p><h2>Twins Days Festival celebrates their identity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/acc/f34/f433a05adeabf5eb20af90e176.jpg><p>On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;Siblings’ Day, they could also enjoy an&nbsp;exclusive event just for them. Twins Days Festival is&nbsp;<a href=#>held</a> every summer, during the first weekend in&nbsp;August in&nbsp;Twinsburg, Ohio. Just being born with a&nbsp;wombmate gives them a&nbsp;rare identity as&nbsp;a&nbsp;twin and they can celebrate it&nbsp;with others who are just like them.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know any interesting stories about twins, perhaps even your own experiences?
