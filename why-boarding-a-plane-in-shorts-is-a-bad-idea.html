And it is not only about discomfort but also about serious consequences. One such example is shorts.</p><p>Very comfortable and often worn in summer, shorts are a terrible choice for flying. Airline employee <strong>Tommy Cimato</strong> explains in a short video why you shouldn't do it. He also lists a few other things to avoid on planes.</p><p>First of all, the tiktoker warns to never touch the toilet flush with your bare hands, as there may be many dangerous bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants there. He also reminds you not to forget to drink water, because it is easy to get dehydrated during the flight.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Another mistake is putting your face up to the glass. We know it can be tempting, but it's also incredibly unhygienic. You never know who's done it before you. And chances are a lot of people have.</p><p>Tommy Cimato also advises against boarding a plane in shorts, a short skirt or dress, or a very low-cut blouse. This is also about hygiene. As he explains, the seats may not be as clean as we hope. It is very likely that there are many contaminants or even pathogens on their surface.</p><p>Besides, during a long flight, when we are motionless, we can simply get cold in very short shorts. And it will not be comfortable. Therefore, it is much better to wear longer ones. It will be more comfortable and safer.</p><p>Finally, the expert warns us not to be afraid or ashamed to inform the staff if we feel <a href=# id=d8f12cbf-6440-4892-8a5e-605d0cc90e14 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>unwell during the flight</a>. They are trained in such situations and it is very likely that they will be able to come to our aid.</p><p>This article was originally published by <a href=# id=8a39b7b8-242f-470a-944f-6cf7528c61d2 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Onet</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cMPHsmSbp5Gnsaq6xmaYZqiclrumecinZKygn6fBtHnIrGSaZZKWsW61w56YaJpiabR2vNU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
