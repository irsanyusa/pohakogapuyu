But is honey really <a href=#>healthy</a>? Here’s what dietitians say about the health benefits of honey.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What is honey made of?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Honey is made from nectar. “Bees collect the dilute-sugary nectar of flora plants, produce an enzymatic activity after ingestion, regurgitate it into honey cells and evaporate a high percentage of the water out of it, producing a super-sweet viscous liquid known as honey,” explains Dana Hunnes, a senior dietitian at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The sweet substance is mostly fructose and glucose — simple <a href=#>sugars</a> that are easily converted by the body into energy — and water.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Honey also contains trace amounts of vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, enzymes, amino acids and flavonoids, says Jenny Friedman, a Philadelphia-based registered dietitian. “These compounds are responsible for some of honey’s potential health benefits and part of what distinguishes the sweetener from more traditional ones like sugar.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Is honey healthy?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Research has linked honey to an improvement in <a href=# rel=noopener>gut microbial balance</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>coughing</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>other respiratory conditions</a>. Because of honey’s trace nutrients, the sweetener has been thought to have antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, along with healing potential for ailments such as sore throats, digestive disorders and burns, Friedman says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#><i>Want to eat healthier but don’t know where to start?

To get many of these benefits, “we’d have to eat a lot of honey,” says Friedman. “And unfortunately, consuming a lot of honey means consuming a lot of calories.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Remember: Honey is sugar — something that <a href=#>Americans consume in excess</a>. The American Heart Association <a href=# rel=noopener>recommends</a> limiting added sugar to about six teaspoons per day for women and about nine teaspoon per day for men, but the average American adult <a href=# rel=noopener>consumes</a> about two to three times more than this.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Consuming sugar in excess amounts has been implicated in causing increased weight gain as well as increased risk of chronic diseases like <a href=#>heart disease</a> and <a href=#>diabetes</a>,” says Meredith Price, a registered dietitian at Priceless Nutrition & Wellness in New York.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Is honey an added sugar?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently <a href=#>required</a> that food labels start differentiating between types of sugar: specifically by calling out <a href=# rel=noopener>added sugars</a>, or sugars that are added to foods when they’re processed or prepared.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And even though honey comes from a natural source, it is still an added sugar, like corn syrup or cane sugar. “A lot of people feel better when they read a food label and see honey instead of sugar,” says Friedman. “However, in the long run, the nuance is more meaningful to the mind than the body. The body pretty much perceives sugar and honey added to foods the same way.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Certain terms on products — like “natural sugars,” “no artificial sugars” or “naturally sweetened” — are often simply marketing tactics, says Price.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What’s the healthiest way to eat honey?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s important to consume honey in moderation, experts say. A little goes a long way. Think of a serving size of honey as about a tablespoon (the size of your thumb or a poker chip), says Friedman. This much honey has about 64 calories and 17 grams of sugar, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>USDA’s food composition database</a>. Aim to keep your daily intake from any added sugar under 100 calories a day for women and 150 calories a day for men, suggests Hunnes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Because honey’s flavor is largely what distinguishes it from other sweeteners, Friedman recommends using it in ways that highlight flavor. Drizzle up to a tablespoon into tea, on top of yogurt, into morning oats or on peanut butter toast. Honey also works well in dressings, she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The main types of honey are organic, dark, light, raw and filtered, says Friedman, but there are <a href=# rel=noopener>over 300 varieties of honey</a>. “The variety refers to where the honey comes from, basically the types of flowers bees have fed on,” she says. “The color, flavor and major nutritional properties of honey all depend on the nectar that the bees used.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So what’s the best type to buy? “It depends on what flavors you’re looking for and how you’re using it. Manuka honey has a stronger and distinct taste that might not make it great for using in baking, for example,” she says. Darker honey is also said to be higher in antioxidants, she notes, but it tends to have a more intense, bitter flavor that not everyone enjoys. “<a href=# rel=noopener>Buckwheat</a> is one variety that has been highlighted for a robust nutrient profile.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When it comes to buying honey, it’s important to do your research. Honey — especially when it’s imported — <a href=#>can be cut</a> with other sweeteners like corn syrup. “Always read the label to determine what you’re getting,” Friedman says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s also easier to detect a genuine product if you can actually get your hands on the honey itself, she says. “True honey is thick and slow moving (though the texture of honey may differ depending on whether it is raw or unfiltered). It shouldn’t spread out like syrup and actually won’t feel too sticky on your hands. The smell is distinct, usually floral.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When possible, try to buy locally produced honey from a place where you can see the honeybees or how the honey is produced, Hunnes says. Doing this makes it more likely that the honey you’re buying is actually honey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWZrf3SDjqKqZqCfo7K6eceemKWsmK58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
