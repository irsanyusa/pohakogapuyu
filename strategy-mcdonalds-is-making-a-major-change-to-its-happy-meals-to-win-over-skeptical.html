The chain is also prioritizing cutting artificial ingredients and adjusting what meals are advertised to children.</p><p>Starting in June, the official US Happy Meal menu — as displayed on menu boards — will only feature combinations that are 600 calories or less.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"It's really what we see as a gentle nudge in encouraging more positive choices," McDonald's head of global nutrition, Julia Braun, told Business Insider.</p><p>McDonald's cut the calories primarily by focusing on cheeseburgers and fries.</p><p>While a cheeseburger Happy Meal will be available upon request, cheeseburgers will no long be featured on the menu or in advertising. And, while customers can order a small fries with a four-piece nugget Happy Meal, they will be restricted to a kids-sized fries for the six-piece meal.</p><p>McDonald's also announced that by 2022, at least 50% of Happy Meals on menus will be 600 calories or less. The chain will also meet McDonald's nutritional criteria: equal to or less than 10% of calories from saturated fat, 650 milligrams of sodium, and 10% of calories from sugar.</p><p>The fast-food giant has struggled to convince critics of its food quality and nutrition.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"As a mom I hear comments all the time that are like, 'you don't eat McDonald's,' or, 'you don't give McDonald's to your kids, right?'"
