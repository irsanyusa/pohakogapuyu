It explains why brands are willing to pay millions of dollars per year in a bid to establish a relationship with the fan bases of sports clubs, events, and organisations.</p><p>But brands from certain industries might be better placed than others to capitalise on the platform of sports sponsorships, according to a new YouGov study conducted across 17 markets worldwide.</p><p>Globally, automobile manufacturers are the most likely to be considered a good fit for sports sponsorships. Over a third of consumers (36%) think automakers are appropriate sponsors of professional sports clubs, leagues or athletes. Tech (34%) and telecommunication (34%) brands follow closely behind. Three in five consumers also consider banks and insurance brands (31%) and tourism (31%) companies as appropriate sponsors for sports properties.</p><p>Pharma brands don’t score too well in comparison, with only one in six (17%) consumers globally saying they make for appropriate sports sponsors.</p><p>Remarkably, despite the gambling industry’s close and long-standing links with sports business, only 12% of consumers say they are “appropriate sponsors of professional sports clubs, leagues or athletes”. Cryptocurrencies have signed a number of noteworthy sports sponsorships lately, but only one in ten consumers think they make for appropriate partners (10%). We have previously looked at <a href=#>whether sports sponsorships help cryptocurrencies acquire legitimacy</a>.</p><p>Sentiments around how appropriate it is for certain industries to engage in sports sponsorships can be quite diverse across various markets. For instance, only 28% of consumers in Singapore think automakers make for appropriate sports sponsors. That number shoots up to 48% of Indonesians (online representative sample).</p><p>Brits and Germans are among the least likely to feel cryptocurrencies are appropriate as sports sponsors (6%), whereas Americans (11%) are far more accepting. Urban Indians top the list, however, with more than one in five of them (22%) saying cryptocurrencies “make for appropriate sponsors of professional sports clubs, leagues or athletes”.</p><p>A fifth of consumers in France (20%) and urban Mexico (20%) think it appropriate for gambling brands to engage in sports sponsorships. Consumers in Britain (7%), Italy (7%) and Singapore (7%) sit at the other end of the spectrum.</p><p>The ability of brands to cash in on sports sponsorships is determined by myriad factors. And a brand from an industry with a low level of approval for sports sponsorships might still be able to launch effective partnerships in the sports industry. But these consumer views are a factor that marketers can keep in mind when developing their plans to engage with sport – or with sponsors.</p><p><strong>Receive monthly topical insights about the sports industry, straight to your inbox. </strong><a href=#><strong>Sign up today</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Discover more </strong><a href=#><strong>sports content </strong></a><strong>here</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Want to run your own research?

All interviews were conducted online in November 2021. Data from each market uses a nationally representative sample apart from Mexico and India, which use urban representative samples, and Indonesia and Hong Kong, which use online representative samples.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLG70a1mmqqknrCtsdJoa2lqZ216qLjOm5ilZaedtqS0jKKlna2jqb%2BqsdJmmKudXZeytMCMrKyirJWZerS8zqurrGWjpbw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
