Historically accurate costumes help&nbsp;us travel through time and feel the atmosphere of&nbsp;the story being told in&nbsp;the best possible way. However, wearing those garments can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;tough job. Actors who played in&nbsp;historic dramas confess that spending long hours in&nbsp;the clothes our ancestors we&nbsp;wearing centuries ago can be&nbsp;tiresome and even torturing.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> came across the interviews of&nbsp;7&nbsp;actresses who shared their experience of&nbsp;playing roles in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> with period costumes, and it&nbsp;looks like they had to&nbsp;overcome quite a&nbsp;few challenges to&nbsp;look convincing on&nbsp;the big screen.</p><h2>1. Lily James on&nbsp;playing Cinderella in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Cinderella</i></a>, 2015</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/925/2b2/a29ca057b29143c72351177817.jpg><p>The blue gown looked fantastic on&nbsp;Lily, but eating while wearing a&nbsp;tight corset became a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>challenge</a> for the actress: “When [the corset] was on&nbsp;we&nbsp;would be&nbsp;on&nbsp;continuous days so&nbsp;we&nbsp;wouldn’t stop for lunch or&nbsp;a&nbsp;lovely tea like this&nbsp;— you’d be&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;eating on&nbsp;the move. In&nbsp;that case, I&nbsp;couldn’t untie the corset. So&nbsp;<strong>if&nbsp;you ate food it&nbsp;didn’t really digest properly and I’d be&nbsp;burping all afternoon</strong>&nbsp;in [Richard Madden]’s face, and it&nbsp;was just really sort of&nbsp;unpleasant. I’d have soup so&nbsp;that&nbsp;I could still eat but it&nbsp;wouldn’t get stuck.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aaa/82b/6a408156bd9c94de020a3423e8.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa2/44a/22617f5a87a4156a16f14bc81c.jpg><p>Saoirse Ronan also had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;tight corset while playing in&nbsp;<i>Mary Queen of&nbsp;Scots</i>, and she had to&nbsp;wear corsets for about 12&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interviews</a>, the actress confessed that those corsets changed her shape and <strong>created curves she had never had before</strong>. This surprising effect lasted not that long, however.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c82/ca5/6a8c0656c188b7ef0d5b93b1a1.jpg><p>While portraying Georgiana in&nbsp;<i>The Duchess</i> movie, <a href=# title="Keira Knightley" data-link=tag>Keira Knightley</a> was wearing panniers under her gorgeous period dresses. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Panniers</a>, or&nbsp;side hoops, are the type of&nbsp;undergarment worn by&nbsp;women to&nbsp;extend the width of&nbsp;their skirts. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> that moving in&nbsp;panniers felt completely different and affected the way she interacted with other actors on&nbsp;set, because<strong> she couldn’t even get close enough to&nbsp;anyone</strong> because of&nbsp;her wide skirts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af6/cbf/c95541582c91b3fb80ec5672a0.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/334/e0c/0ff6f153caaf3305f92645f158.jpg><h2>4.

The wedding gown Emma wears in&nbsp;the shows was so&nbsp;massive that she needed help of&nbsp;many people to&nbsp;get dressed. “We&nbsp;were filming the scene when you first see her in&nbsp;the wedding dress&nbsp;— I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;was Lancaster House in&nbsp;London&nbsp;— and&nbsp;<strong>I had a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;about 10&nbsp;people helping me&nbsp;put it&nbsp;on</strong>, because it’s massive,” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/090/ea1/1c4d615069a1cf9b88695a17f1.jpg><p>The actress recalled that playing in&nbsp;<i>The Great Gatsby</i> made her really nervous. The thing is&nbsp;that Carey <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>felt</a> “the weight of&nbsp;responsibility” while wearing all those gorgeous diamonds that were part of&nbsp;her costume, and <strong>she was afraid to&nbsp;lose them</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1a1/536/bb91105ec4835773ce9f2259cc.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e8/23d/ccf89f571da0f84fc642d0b32c.jpg><p>The dress <a href=# title="Julia Roberts" data-link=tag>Julia Roberts</a> was wearing while portraying the Queen was very big and heavy and the actress used a&nbsp;special tent to&nbsp;put that dress&nbsp;on. “I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;tent on&nbsp;the stage that&nbsp;I went in&nbsp;to&nbsp;dress because that dress doesn’t go&nbsp;into any modern doorway and <strong>that dress weighed, I&nbsp;think, 60&nbsp;pounds</strong>,” Julia <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d3/f2f/e17a2958faa26ebe49ef40add4.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f1/200/1847cc5beca67af6b483938ab8.jpg><p>The challenges <a href=# title="Cate Blanchett" data-link=tag>Cate Blanchett</a> was facing while playing Queen Elizabeth I&nbsp;were connected to&nbsp;her hair. “In&nbsp;that time, people were wearing wigs because of&nbsp;fleas and mites. Hers are deliberately wiggy and theatrical. And they were really heavy, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;affected how much you could move. I&nbsp;also <strong>bleached my&nbsp;eyelashes and eyebrows</strong>. I&nbsp;quite liked&nbsp;it, really, that pale-redhead look,” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you like watching period movies with costumes?
