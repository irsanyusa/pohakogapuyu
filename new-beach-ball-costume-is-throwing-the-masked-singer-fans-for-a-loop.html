Beach Ball is the latest costume to be revealed before the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sept. 22 premiere</a>. Fans are actually a little confused by the costume and which celebrity could be underneath.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-masked-singer-reveals-season-6-beach-ball-costume>‘The Masked Singer’ Reveals Season 6 Beach Ball Costume</h2><p>Beach Ball is red, white, and blue with huge eyelashes. The costume has bright blue eyes which can always be a clue to a contestant’s identity. They are also wearing red lipstick, a signature look that many celebrities like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani</a> can rock. Stefani is way too busy to appear on the show this season, but keep the lipstick in mind.</p><p>The most interesting thing about Beach Ball’s costume is that it looks so tiny compared to all of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the other costumes</a>. Beach Ball is perched on a sandy platform which we assume is covering the person’s legs. The real way to judge how tall Beach Ball is is when we get to see them standing next to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Cannon</a>.</p><p>Beach Ball is giving us Snail energy from Season 5. Snail was very small and viewers wondered who could fit in the costume besides a child. It turned out to be what the show labeled as “the biggest reveal of all time” with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kermit the Frog</a>. Some fans are hoping that The Masked Singer does not give us another Muppet reveal this season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CTiVDTvHqZy/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-under-the-mask>Who is Under the Mask?</h2><p>The most popular guess so far is that Miss Piggy is under the mask. She does have blue eyes and long eyelashes so it would make sense. She could also fit inside of the costume and perform on the show inspired by her buddy Kermit. One person suggested that it could be Elmo underneath the mask.</p><p>“If that’s another muppet, this show loses all credibility,” one fan wrote on Instagram.</p><p>Both Elmo and Miss Piggy have instantly recognizable voices. We will know right away once we hear Beach Ball sing. Kermit threw everyone for a loop because we only ever assumed that people are under the masks. Now that we know puppets are allowed on the show, anything goes for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 6</a>.</p><p>“I ain’t falling for it again,” another fan wrote. “This is a muppet.”</p><p>Everyone has assumed that a novelty character will be under this mask. The best reveals are always the ones that you least expect. It could be a huge child star under the mask or a big name. Contrary to how it may seem, this is not the weirdest costume of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the season</a>. There is an image floating around the internet of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baby costume</a> that is expected to be revealed later this month. Things are getting weird!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1132752095.jpg alt="‘AGT’s Keith Apicary Hosts “Forever” Live Stream Fundraiser to Buy a House" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zZ6uZpqVlrCpecGao6Vlk6TAtcHMnmSiq12ptbO71qKloGWknbJuucCsop6cXai2r7PEq2SfmZ6oeqe70WaYZqSfpL1w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
