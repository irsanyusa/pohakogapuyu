Here’s his tweet;</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>‘Bank Alert’ was released in September 2016, and served as the reunification single after their publicised row in 2016. The song was an instant hit, and the video featured cameos from Nollywood star John ‘Mr Ibu’ Okafor, and legendary singer, Onyeka Onwenu. It has over 30 million views on Youtube.</p><p>The drama in the family of the&nbsp;<strong>Okoye</strong>&nbsp;brothers has been one that has gradually garnered negative momentum. A faction-based relationship which still exists has seen group singer&nbsp;<strong>Paul Okoye</strong>&nbsp;team up with older sibling&nbsp;<strong>Jude</strong>&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;<strong>Peter</strong>&nbsp;all alone.</p><p>The latter has seem the less influential in a state of affairs that has resulted in life threats and hot tempered moments.</p><p>Media and music business veteran, Kenny Ogungbe thinks it is only a publicity stunt.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>'Baba Keke', as he is also known spoke on a live programme on&nbsp;<strong>Kennis FM</strong>&nbsp;where he confidently stated that their recent clash was only a build-up to a planned show.#</p><p>“I am sure they have a massive show coming up in December and they are using this as a publicity stunt. They have over 100 songs and people who called us on the radio within 15 minutes, requested for about 29 of their songs.</p><p>“If you are breaking up after recording about 100 songs, will you break up to record another big song as a solo artiste? At what age? How many songs are they going to release that would be up to what they have released already?</p><p>"At what age do they want to do that when people are interested in listening to songs released by younger artistes? Quote me anywhere that I said it is a game. In the video that was released online, Paul said it was a shame to Peter. It is a game (laughs)."</p><p>Ogungbe had the features of a self-assured person in his radio comments about the duo returning to perform once again as a group. But if this doesn't happen, he wishes them success in their endeavours.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2S9tL3UmqmeZaCWwq15zqSmsp1dp7KovsStqmaZlJm2r7OMqZytnaJiwbB5x6KqZqufobxursCnomaZnJq%2FtXnVopuep19sfqiEl26v</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
