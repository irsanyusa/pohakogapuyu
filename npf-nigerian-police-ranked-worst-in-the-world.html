There were only four nonEuropean countries in the top 20. The United Arab Emirates was the highest ranked country from the Middle East and North African (MENA) region, and ranked 29th overall.</p><p>“Nigeria performed worst on the Index, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Uganda, and Pakistan. However, countries with protracted civil conflicts are not eligible for the Index.</p><p>“North America and Europe were the two regions with the best average WISPI scores. Sub-Saharan Africa had the worst average score, followed by South Asia and then Central America and the Caribbean.</p><p>“Despite the turmoil in the Middle East, many Middle Eastern countries performed well on the Index. The MENA region had the fourth best average regional score of the nine regions in the Index.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Countries with smaller populations performed better on the Index than larger ones. Only one country in the top ten had a population greater than 25 million, and conversely only one country in the bottom ten had a population of less than 25 million.</p><p>“Full democracies had the best average score on the Index, followed by flawed democracies. Authoritarian regimes outperform hybrid regimes, despite the fact that the country with the best score in the Index (Singapore) is a hybrid regime.</p><p>“Authoritarian regimes in sub-Saharan Africa had smaller police forces and militaries than their Middle Eastern counterparts. Overall, sub-Saharan African countries had the lowest capacity scores of any region.</p><p>“The resources devoted to policing and the criminal justice system have increased dramatically over the past 50 years. In the US, GDP per capita increased 191 per cent from 1961 to 2015 (when measured in constant 2005 US dollars). Over the same period, local, state, and federal government spending on the police increased 484 per cent.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Corruption has been increasing around the globe in the last 20 years. In many countries, bribe payments to the police are still commonplace. The Index average for bribe payments to police was 30 per cent, with more than 50 per cent of respondents admitting to having paid a bribe to police in 33 of the 127 countries in the Index.”</p><p>Speaking with the spokesman of the police force, <a href=# id=ca4484f0-142f-5d45-aa0b-b3e15b40aa5b>Jimoh Moshood</a>, he rejected the report noting that Nigeria police is the best in Africa.</p><p>The rating was made possible through the outcome of <a href=# id=793442eb-e7b6-5a94-9ee2-c47d1fa31138>‘Trends in Internal Security</a> and Policing, Results and Trends by Domain: Capacity, Results and Trends by Domain: Process and Legitimacy and finally the Results and Trends by Domain: Outcomes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyvvMVmpaKflae2orqMqaaloZOaerOtzaScnWWnpL%2B0wIyipWasmJp6uLvRpZtoaJeigrq5zw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
