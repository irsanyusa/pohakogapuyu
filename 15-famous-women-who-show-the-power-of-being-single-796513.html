This expert even says, “If&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;man, you should probably get married, if&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;woman, don’t bother.” This just further proves that people shouldn’t listen to&nbsp;what society says is&nbsp;normal and should just follow their hearts. In&nbsp;addition, there are many celebrity women who remind&nbsp;us of&nbsp;much more important things in&nbsp;our lives than romantic relationships and inspire&nbsp;us to&nbsp;put ourselves first.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> invite you along to&nbsp;celebrate these amazing ladies who prove that having a&nbsp;man doesn’t define our <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a>.</p><p><h2>1. Jennifer Aniston</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/38c/f7d/14edbc524daa86535ee740167c.jpg><p>Aniston’s <a href=#>romantic life</a> can rival her storyline on&nbsp;Friends, which most of&nbsp;us know and <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. First, she went through heartbreak with <a href=# title="Brad Pitt" data-link=tag>Brad Pitt</a> in&nbsp;2005, which made her take her heart off the market for several years. Then, she found love again with Justin Theroux, but their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> also wasn’t meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;and ended in&nbsp;2017. Throughout this time, Jen remained the ultimate inspiration to&nbsp;women everywhere and still seems very happy (just take her successful <a href=#>career</a>, for example).</p><p>However, it’s the public attention about her private life that made her snap at&nbsp;one point and make a&nbsp;statement explaining that her happiness isn’t defined by&nbsp;love. As&nbsp;Aniston wrote in&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful <a href=#>essay</a>: “We&nbsp;are complete with or&nbsp;without a&nbsp;mate, with or&nbsp;without a&nbsp;child... <strong>We&nbsp;don’t need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married or&nbsp;mothers to&nbsp;be&nbsp;complete</strong>. We&nbsp;get to&nbsp;determine our own ‘happily ever after’ for ourselves.”</p><p><h2>2. Emilia Clarke</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e1/13b/dacc365abdb9a1e74dbecd5d1c.jpg><p>Despite being one of&nbsp;the most successful&nbsp;TV actresses of&nbsp;our time, Clarke has kept her love life mostly private. Her relationship with comedian Seth MacFarlane is&nbsp;the only one she’s officially <a href=#>confirmed</a>, but other than that, the Game of&nbsp;Thrones star has mostly been dedicated to&nbsp;her <a href=#>career</a>.</p><p>Emilia once <a href=#>explained</a> that she had chosen to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;herself first and likes it&nbsp;that way: “People keep asking me&nbsp;who I’m dating right now and the truth&nbsp;is... wait for [it]... no&nbsp;one. And that’s OK. <strong>I’m figuring out a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stuff right now.</strong> I&nbsp;think as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, it’s in&nbsp;our nature to&nbsp;nurture someone else. Sometimes at&nbsp;the expense of&nbsp;ourselves.”</p><p><h2>3. Lady Gaga</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/948/0de/602819570f9d1805780a0e69a5.jpg><p>The first thing that comes to&nbsp;mind when we&nbsp;think of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Lady Gaga" data-link=tag>Lady Gaga</a> is&nbsp;her pop icon <a href=#>status</a>, while her personal life remains a&nbsp;second thought. She was previously <a href=#>engaged</a> to&nbsp;her long-time boyfriend Taylor Kinney (sadly that <a href=#>didn’t work out</a>), but <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> remains the love of&nbsp;her life. And don’t forget she also <a href=#>won</a> an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Oscar data-link=tag>Oscar</a> for A&nbsp;Star is&nbsp;Born!</p><p>Gaga <a href=#>believes</a> that you need to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;yourself first, before committing to&nbsp;another person: “Some women choose to&nbsp;follow men, and <strong>some women choose to&nbsp;follow their dreams</strong>. If&nbsp;you’re wondering which way to&nbsp;go, remember that your <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> will never wake up&nbsp;and tell you that it&nbsp;doesn’t love you anymore.”</p><p><h2>4. Emma Watson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5bc/325/691ec15192bb82a92a724a8a5d.jpg><p>Everyone’s sweetheart <a href=# title="Emma Watson" data-link=tag>Emma Watson</a> has never publicly confirmed having a&nbsp;boyfriend. Instead, the actress has been keeping busy: she <a href=#>received</a> a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;English literature from Brown, continued to&nbsp;<a href=#>shine</a> on&nbsp;the big screen, and has grown up&nbsp;into an&nbsp;admirable young lady.</p><p>And yet, The Harry Potter star once <a href=#>admitted</a> she didn’t believe in&nbsp;being happy without a&nbsp;boyfriend, but has realized that she was wrong: “I&nbsp;never believed in&nbsp;the whole ‘I’m happy single’ spiel. I&nbsp;was like, ‘This is&nbsp;totally spiel.’ It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;a&nbsp;long time, but <strong>I’m very happy [being single]. I&nbsp;call it&nbsp;being self-partnered.</strong>”</p><p><h2>5. Diane Keaton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/232/81a/64b72155deb619e4cee2e39691.jpg><p>The great Diane Keaton can boast several high-profile boyfriends from her past, which <a href=#>include</a> Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, and Al&nbsp;Pacino, but she’s never said, “I&nbsp;do” to&nbsp;any of&nbsp;them. Instead, she’s slayed at&nbsp;being a&nbsp;talented actress (hello, <a href=#>Oscar</a> for Best Actress in&nbsp;Annie Hall) and has over 60&nbsp;acting <a href=#>credits</a> to&nbsp;her name. Her personal life is&nbsp;also fulfilled as&nbsp;she’s a&nbsp;proud mom to&nbsp;2&nbsp;<a href=#>adopted</a> children.</p><p>Keaton once <a href=#>shared</a> her thoughts on&nbsp;marriage: “I&nbsp;don’t think that because I’m not married it’s made my&nbsp;life any less. <strong>That old maid myth is&nbsp;garbage.</strong>”</p><p><h2>6. Rihanna</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/596/691/c5aa4b56088eddf10d7ed1fd7e.jpg><p><a href=# title=Rihanna data-link=tag>Rihanna</a> doesn’t like to&nbsp;talk about her personal life. She once <a href=#>alluded</a> to&nbsp;being in&nbsp;love, but it&nbsp;looks like her career has always remained a&nbsp;priority. She conquered the music industry by&nbsp;releasing 8&nbsp;successful studio <a href=#>albums</a>, which brought her 9&nbsp;<a href=#>Grammys</a>, and now she’s slaying the <a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a> game. In&nbsp;2017, she launched the makeup <a href=#>company</a> Fenty Beauty, that’s already a&nbsp;favorite for many women.</p><p>There’s no&nbsp;doubt that Rihanna has a&nbsp;lot on&nbsp;her plate, even without a&nbsp;boyfriend to&nbsp;take care&nbsp;of. The singer <a href=#>knows</a> very well how much effort goes into a&nbsp;relationship, and she prefers to&nbsp;keep her focus elsewhere: “Guys need attention. <strong>They need that nourishment</strong>... I’ll give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, <strong>I’ll give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;work</strong>&nbsp;— but&nbsp;I will not give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man right now.”</p><p><h2>7. Drew Barrymore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/182/bbf/1865115d1c816d29cb0b967b89.jpg><p>The famous actress has been <a href=#>married</a> 3&nbsp;times in&nbsp;her life, but her marriage with Will Kopelman was the only one that lasted over a&nbsp;year. Will and Drew tied the knot in&nbsp;2012 and had 2&nbsp;beautiful daughters, but they couldn’t keep the family together and divorced in&nbsp;2016. Meanwhile, Barrymore keeps her status as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> icon: her <a href=#>filmography</a> includes over 70&nbsp;films and&nbsp;TV shows, and she also managed to&nbsp;launch her own cosmetics <a href=#>brand</a>, FLOWER Beauty.</p><p>Being single doesn’t bring Barrymore down, even for a&nbsp;second, as&nbsp;she <a href=#>prefers</a> to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the positives in&nbsp;her life: “I&nbsp;have fought my&nbsp;way to&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeper happiness on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own, and&nbsp;<strong>I love being independent!</strong> It&nbsp;just rules. I&nbsp;am also lucky enough to&nbsp;have 2&nbsp;young amazing kids and a&nbsp;full-time job, and rad friends. So&nbsp;I’m not sitting around bummed out. I&nbsp;feel stupid grateful.”</p><p><h2>8. Susan Sarandon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f4/139/7db7ea58bea4a485b2169f8b3b.jpg><p>Stunning Susan Sarandon had her life filled with romance thanks to&nbsp;<a href=#>men</a> like musician David Bowie, and actors Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, among others. Officially, Sarandon has been single since 2015, but she’s been keeping busy with acting. Her impressive acting <a href=#>career</a> includes over 160 credits and one Oscar <a href=#>win</a>. She’s also a&nbsp;mom to&nbsp;3&nbsp;<a href=#>children</a>, so&nbsp;her life is&nbsp;filled with plenty of&nbsp;love.</p><p>Susan once <a href=#>shared</a> her insights on&nbsp;being on&nbsp;her own: “[Single life] has been a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;different things. It’s traumatic and exhilarating. The one thing that’s been really clear to&nbsp;me&nbsp;is&nbsp;that you have to&nbsp;<strong>think of&nbsp;your own life and your relationship and everything as&nbsp;a&nbsp;living organism</strong>. It’s constantly moving, changing, growing.”</p><p><h2>9. Elisabeth Moss</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a1c/d8b/0bc8de52009326fb0ca91110ea.jpg><p>It’s sometimes funny how a&nbsp;career can go&nbsp;upward after a&nbsp;failed marriage, and Elisabeth Moss is&nbsp;a&nbsp;prime example. When Moss was <a href=#>married</a> to&nbsp;Fred Armisen from 2009 to&nbsp;2011, her role in&nbsp;the famous <a href=#>series</a> Mad Men was the only big credit to&nbsp;her name. Since then, however, she landed the hit <a href=#>show</a> The Handmaid’s Tale, which is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;full swing, and starred in&nbsp;several feature <a href=#>films</a>, and <a href=#>won</a> 2&nbsp;Golden Globes.</p><p>Overall, Moss said she <a href=#>loved</a> the freedom that came with being single and it&nbsp;looks like it&nbsp;truly was the inspiration she needed: “It’s fun to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out at&nbsp;night and not know what’s going to&nbsp;happen. <strong>I’m addicted and obsessed with my&nbsp;freedom</strong> in&nbsp;that sense. I’m having fun!”</p><p><h2>10. Charlize Theron</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78f/3b7/8a4d435781aa0006d83bba1d15.jpg><p>Like many other successful actresses on&nbsp;our list, Theron has had several high-profile relationships, but has never been married. Instead, she <a href=#>won</a> an&nbsp;Oscar for Monster (2003), <a href=#>starred</a> in&nbsp;over 60&nbsp;films, and is&nbsp;actively producing many projects. But most importantly, Charlize is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom. She <a href=#>adopted</a> 2&nbsp;kids in&nbsp;2012 and 2015 and raises them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mom.</p><p>Theron <a href=#>explained</a> her stance on&nbsp;being single in&nbsp;2014: “I’m sure there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;aspects to&nbsp;my&nbsp;life that a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people wouldn’t want... Just personal choice things, like the fact that I’m single at&nbsp;38. That’s not necessarily what a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;women want... But I’m just saying, <strong>a</strong>&nbsp;<strong>life is&nbsp;good if&nbsp;it’s the life that you want</strong>... But I&nbsp;work at&nbsp;that, you know?”</p><p><h2>11. Kim Cattrall</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dab/abb/ed89a15a728fc162a58e144ef5.jpg><p>Similarly to&nbsp;her character on&nbsp;Sex and the City, Kim Cattrall is&nbsp;her own woman and doesn’t need a&nbsp;man to&nbsp;complete her. But she hasn’t always been like that. Cattrall has been <a href=#>married</a> 3&nbsp;times in&nbsp;her life, but she always put herself first. Her last marriage ended in&nbsp;2004 and since then she’s been living for herself: Kim <a href=#>frequently</a> pops up&nbsp;on&nbsp;TV and the big screen and returned to&nbsp;her role as&nbsp;Samantha Jones twice for movie adaptations of&nbsp;the famous <a href=#>show</a> Sex and the City.</p><p>Cattrall once <a href=#>discussed</a> the ups and downs of&nbsp;being on&nbsp;her own: “It’s amazing freedom you have with [being single] and then the thought of&nbsp;someone invading your space... I&nbsp;guess there’re those moments where you think, ’If I’m having a&nbsp;bad day, who do&nbsp;I call?’ <strong>There are lonely moments</strong>, but&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;tell you honestly, that for myself, <strong>so&nbsp;many women in&nbsp;relationships are very loving, but also lonely too.</strong>”</p><p><h2>12. Mindy Kaling</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e8/ed9/8cf6d65c169ae139f385137c77.jpg><p>The star of&nbsp;The Office takes the crown for being the most private about her romantic life. In&nbsp;2017, Kaling <a href=#>gave birth</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby girl, but to&nbsp;this day the identity of&nbsp;her father is&nbsp;unknown. We&nbsp;didn’t expect this from someone who’s written 2&nbsp;honest <a href=#>memoirs</a> and given herself numerous boyfriends on&nbsp;her <a href=#>show</a> The Mindy Project, but we&nbsp;salute Mindy for wanting privacy.</p><p>Kaling <a href=#>said</a> that the wisdom of&nbsp;single life came to&nbsp;her with age: “It’s funny, I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;freak out about being single much more in&nbsp;my&nbsp;twenties. I’ve noticed that the more professional success I&nbsp;have, or&nbsp;the more happy I&nbsp;am professionally, the less&nbsp;I worry about that, because&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;great deal of&nbsp;professional confidence... <strong>I&nbsp;love being by&nbsp;myself.</strong> I&nbsp;think that if&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;the wrong relationship, which&nbsp;I have been in&nbsp;several, that would be&nbsp;so&nbsp;much worse than the feeling of&nbsp;autonomy&nbsp;I feel right now.”</p><p><h2>13. Jane Fonda</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a8/9a7/4ba5145bab9733757c6424c47f.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jane Fonda" data-link=tag>Jane Fonda</a> has been single since 2001 when she <a href=#>divorced</a> her third husband and she doesn’t miss&nbsp;it. The best things she got from her marriages were her children: she had a&nbsp;daughter with her first husband, a&nbsp;son and an&nbsp;unofficially adopted girl with her second. Becoming permanently single allowed Fonda to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;<a href=#>acting</a> (she took a&nbsp;hiatus from 1990 to&nbsp;2005) and retain her status as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hollywood icon. As&nbsp;Jane once <a href=#>said</a>: “<strong>I’m single, which makes me&nbsp;very happy.</strong>”</p><p>She also <a href=#>wrote</a> about her daily life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single gal: “...the fact is&nbsp;that&nbsp;I spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time alone and cherish that...I&nbsp;am alone a&nbsp;lot. I&nbsp;read a&nbsp;lot. I&nbsp;meditate. I&nbsp;love solitude. It’s different than loneliness.”</p><p><h2>14. Nicki Minaj</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c55/6fb/7efa5c544da34dff2486a074a7.jpg><p>Aside from being a&nbsp;rap <a href=#>legend</a> and one of&nbsp;the most successful female performers in&nbsp;a&nbsp;male-dominated industry, Minaj is&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman who’s been in&nbsp;love a&nbsp;few <a href=#>times</a>. But what’s interesting is&nbsp;that she used to&nbsp;think she can’t be&nbsp;complete without a&nbsp;man. Nicki craved a&nbsp;relationship, but it&nbsp;was when she realized she’s her own independent woman, that she was able to&nbsp;find love and get <a href=#>married</a>.</p><p>Minaj shared her <a href=#>epiphany</a>: “As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I realized that&nbsp;I could actually live and breathe, and eat and sleep, and walk and talk without having a&nbsp;boyfriend, something clicked in&nbsp;me. <strong>Becoming single was one of&nbsp;the things that made me&nbsp;feel strong and powerful.</strong> The fact that I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;young woman who doesn’t need a&nbsp;man for money.”</p><p><h2>15. Cher</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ac/158/70f7cd5e01a7369509f0a7ac8e.jpg><p><a href=# title=Cher data-link=tag>Cher</a> is&nbsp;someone who doesn’t need any introduction, but let&nbsp;us remind you of&nbsp;her achievements: she’s <a href=#>released</a> 26&nbsp;studio albums as&nbsp;a&nbsp;solo artist, <a href=#>received</a> 141&nbsp;awards, which also includes an&nbsp;<a href=#>Oscar</a> for Moonstruck (1987), and <a href=#>starred</a> in&nbsp;over 60&nbsp;movies and shows. It’s no&nbsp;wonder her last <a href=#>marriage</a> ended in&nbsp;1979, who’s got time for men when you have the entire world to&nbsp;conquer! Cher also has 2&nbsp;kids, so&nbsp;she’s always had her hands full.</p><p>The singer once <a href=#>shared</a> wise words we&nbsp;should all live&nbsp;by: “A&nbsp;man is&nbsp;absolutely not a&nbsp;necessity... [But] I&nbsp;love men! <strong>I&nbsp;think men are the coolest. But you don’t really need them to&nbsp;live.</strong>”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about women proudly embracing being single? Is&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic relationship in&nbsp;our lives overrated?</p><p>After keeping fans guessing for nearly a&nbsp;year, <a href=#>Rihanna</a> has finally revealed the name of&nbsp;her baby son as ’RZA Athelston.’ The name pays homage to&nbsp;the esteemed rapper and producer RZA, leader of&nbsp;the Wu-Tang Clan. Rihanna and her partner A$AP Rocky, who shares the middle name Athelston with their son, had previously dropped subtle hints about the name. The revelation comes amidst Rihanna’s second pregnancy, which she announced during a&nbsp;Super Bowl halftime performance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecWapKito2LEsLnEp2SwoJ9iwKm71maroZ1dpby4sdFmpp9lkpq2r7OMrKCnn5yaeniFlW5obGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
