According to a new report, this was the show’s highest-rated premiere in six years.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rupaul-s-drag-race-season-15-is-a-hit-in-the-ratings>RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 15 Is a Hit in the Ratings</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, the season premiere of Drag Race had a 0.63 rating among the 18-49 demographic. That makes it the show’s highest-rated premiere in six years, up 20 percent from the Season 14 premiere.</p><p>Deadline speculates that the boost in ratings has to do with the show’s move from VH1 to MTV. There was a similar ratings spike when the show previously moved from its former home at Logo TV to VH1. MTV reportedly performs better than VH1 in general.</p><p>In addition to being the No. 1 cable entertainment telecast for the day, the show was also the most social program, excluding sports, on broadcast and cable on Friday. It was also the show’s most social premiere ever with 1.3 million interactions. This was up by 212% from the Season 14 premiere.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW ‘RUPAUL’S DRAG RACE’ UPPED THE GAME FOR POP CULTURE</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-this-season-features-a-few-changes>This Season Features a Few Changes</h2><p>In addition to airing on a new network, there are also a couple of other changes for Drag Race Season 15.
