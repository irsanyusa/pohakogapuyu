When danger might actually await&nbsp;us on&nbsp;every corner. Hopefully this time a&nbsp;young boy could throw all the panic away and prevent what could have become a&nbsp;very tragic accident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/53e/ebe/c4a2945fc791294bd78e23c57d.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;usual Wednesday afternoon. The yellow bus was riding children after school right to&nbsp;their homes. When suddenly the driver felt a&nbsp;bit dizzy while driving. Following the protocol a&nbsp;40-year-old woman alerted the home base that she wasn’t feeling well and needed some help.</p><p>She was going to&nbsp;pull over at&nbsp;some certain point and allow the transportation department to&nbsp;send someone to&nbsp;provide relief to&nbsp;her. But unfortunately, she didn’t make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;where she planned to&nbsp;park and eventually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>passed out</a> right in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the ride.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/627/644/bfb8ca5c9b9d78a1d606d1db0b.jpg><p>The driver couldn’t stop the bus now, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;started to&nbsp;veer into oncoming traffic. Dillon Reeves, a&nbsp;quick-thinking 7th-grader who was seated about five rows back was the only one who didn’t panic at&nbsp;the time. He&nbsp;“jumped up&nbsp;from his seat, ran to&nbsp;the front of&nbsp;the bus, grabbed the steering wheel, and brought the bus to&nbsp;a&nbsp;stop in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the road.”</p><p>In&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> released, Dillon is&nbsp;seen taking control of&nbsp;the steering wheel immediately after the driver lost consciousness. He&nbsp;slowly started to&nbsp;push the brakes, and then he&nbsp;was heard yelling to&nbsp;other kids behind, “Someone call 911. Now. Someone should call 911... I&nbsp;don’t care! Someone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>call 911</a>!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/621/029/7cf22052deb66811340b9b33d0.jpg><p>There were probably about 66&nbsp;passengers at&nbsp;the time. And the kid managed to&nbsp;stop the bus slowly despite the justifiable panic of&nbsp;all the kids. Police and fire departments responded to&nbsp;the scene within minutes. They helped the driver. All students were loaded onto another bus to&nbsp;make their way <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>home</a>.</p><p>Nobody of&nbsp;the children got any injuries. The driver was stable and was transported to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a> for examination. The bus also wasn’t damaged after all, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;all the surrounding property and anyone on&nbsp;the road. In&nbsp;this matter, Dillon did it&nbsp;all like a&nbsp;real pro!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d2e/597/3d17575d119a6419bb22254618.jpg><p>Dillon’s parents couldn’t be&nbsp;more proud of&nbsp;their son. They praised him and called him “our little <a href=# title=hero data-link=tag>hero</a>”. “First off, we&nbsp;are very, very proud. I&nbsp;mean, this is&nbsp;overwhelming for all of&nbsp;us,” said his father, Steve Reeves. And all the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>people</a> of&nbsp;Michigan shared his feelings toward this very courageous boy.</p><p>“Dillon, he’s really been a&nbsp;great guy this year. He&nbsp;has come a&nbsp;long way,” added his mother, Ireta Reeves. “He&nbsp;has surprised&nbsp;us with great grades and with his performances at&nbsp;schools with friends, with peers. And to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something like this just fills my&nbsp;<a href=# title=heart data-link=tag>heart</a>, makes my&nbsp;heart skip a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beat</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b77/765/10f2445629979b81d4c27e28cc.jpg><p>It&nbsp;turns out that not every hero wears a&nbsp;uniform or&nbsp;a&nbsp;cape. Yet many of&nbsp;them don’t hesitate to&nbsp;prevent an&nbsp;alarming situation from taking a&nbsp;turn for the worse and do&nbsp;all possible to&nbsp;<a href=#>save people</a> around no&nbsp;matter what.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5ut8idZKaZnpa0prCMraZmq6SkvW6tjKyaoaefoXqjwdJmmJ%2Bslad6tbTEZpuroaaav264zqyrZpufo8Cktc6uqqedo6h6eX2TbmlwZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
