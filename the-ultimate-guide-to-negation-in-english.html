To give you a better understanding of how they work, we’ve outlined how you can negate sentences with modal verbs and typical verb structures.</span></p><h2><strong>What are negation sentences?</strong></h2><p><span>We use negation sentences in English when we want to state something with “not”, as in not true or negative. Negation sentences are structured differently depending on the tense and type of phrase or verb you’re using. However, one important rule is that no matter the tense, we never use two negative words in a row.</span></p><p><span>The following sections outline the different ways you should structure negation sentences.</span></p><h3><strong>Negation with modal verbs</strong></h3><p><span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Modal verbs</a></strong></span><span> are a set of verbs in English that often come with their own particular grammar rules. They are used to describe either obligation, probability, or possibility:</span></p><table><tbody readability=1><tr><td><strong>Used for</strong></td><td><strong>Modal verb</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Obligation</strong></td><td><span>must</span><p><span>*to have to</span></p><p><span>will</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Probability</strong></td><td><span>should</span><p><span>could</span></p><p><span>would</span></p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Possibility</strong></td><td><span>might&nbsp;</span><p><span>may</span></p><p><span>can</span></p><p><span>*to be able to</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>Important note: there are a few more modal verb structures with exceptions that are noted with a * that will be discussed in their respective sections.</span></p><p><span>When we want to negate a sentence with a modal verb, we use the following structure:</span></p><h4>modal verb + not + main verb (infinitive form)</h4><p><span>For example:</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>can not speak</strong><span> French.</span></p><p><span>You </span><strong>should not smoke</strong><span> here.</span></p><p><span>He </span><strong>may not need</strong><span> to go home now.</span></p><p><span>They </span><strong>must not learn</strong><span> English.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>will not cook</strong><span> dinner tonight.</span></p><p><span>We also use contractions for some negation verbs, meaning a shorter form of the verb. With the above examples, the contraction versions are:</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>can’t speak</strong><span> French.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You </span><strong>shouldn’t smoke</strong><span> here.</span></p><p><span>They </span><strong>mustn’t learn</strong><span> English.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>won’t cook</strong><span> dinner tonight. (note here that the contraction form of “will not” does not follow regular modal verb contraction rules)</span></p><p><span>We don’t use contractions with the modal verbs “may” and “might”.</span></p><h2><strong>Negation with “to be”</strong></h2><p><span>The verb “to be” is a highly irregular verb in English, so it again follows different negation rules than most modal verbs, and also changes between present simple and present continuous.</span></p><h3><strong>Present simple “to be” negation</strong></h3><p><span>When we create a negation sentence with “to be” in </span><span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">present simple</a></strong></span><span>, we use the following structure:</span></p><h4><strong>am/is/are + not</strong></h4><p><span>For example:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>am not</strong><span> home.</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>are not</strong><span> happy.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>is not</strong><span> upset.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We can also use contractions for “to be” negations as well:</span></p><p><strong>I’m not</strong><span> home. (Note here that the contraction takes place with “I am” and leaves “not” in place)</span></p><p><strong>We aren’t</strong><span> happy.</span></p><p><b>She isn’t</b><span> upset.</span></p><p><span>*The modal verb exception with “to be able to” follows the rules of “to be” instead of the typical modal verb negation rule, because “to be” is part of the phrase:</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>am not able</strong><span> to make it to dinner tonight.</span></p><p><span>They </span><strong>are not able</strong><span> to sit outside.</span></p><p><span>He </span><strong>is not able</strong><span> to drive a car.</span></p><h3><strong>Present continuous “to be” negation</strong></h3><p><span>The verb “to be” also has a similar structure when we negate present continuous:</span></p><h4><strong>am/is/are + not + gerund (-ing verb)</strong></h4><p><span>For example:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>are not going</strong><span> home now.</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>am not talking</strong><span> to you.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>is not walking</strong><span> to the store.</span></p><p><span>There is no change with contractions here and they follow the same pattern as “to be” in present simple:</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>aren’t going</strong><span> home now.</span></p><p><strong>I’m not talking</strong><span> to you.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>isn’t walking</strong><span> to the store.</span></p><p><span>Note that also for both past simple and past continuous, the same negation structures are used. You would only need to use the past tense form of “to be” which is “was/were”.</span></p><h2><strong>Negation with “do”</strong></h2><p><span>We can negate any sentence in English in the simple present or simple past (except modal verbs and “to be”) with the structure:</span></p><h4><strong>do/does (auxiliary verb) + not + main verb (infinitive form)</strong></h4><p><span>A few examples are:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>does not speak</strong><span> Spanish.</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>do not like</strong><span> chocolate.</span></p><p><span>They </span><strong>do not take</strong><span> the train.</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>do not eat</strong><span> lunch so late.</span></p><p><span>When we want to use contractions, we use the following structure:</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>doesn’t speak</strong><span> Spanish.</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>don’t like</strong><span> chocolate.</span></p><p><span>They </span><strong>don’t take</strong><span> the train.</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>don’t eat</strong><span> lunch so late.</span></p><p><span>*The modal verb “to have to” falls into this category, because it begins with the word “to”. So it uses the same structure as above (also with contractions):</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>do not have to</strong><span> work tomorrow.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>does not have to</strong><span> make dinner.</span></p><p><span>They </span><strong>do not have to</strong><span> go home.</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>do not have to</strong><span> go shopping.</span></p><p><span>You can also use the same structure here for verbs in past tenses. You would only need to use the past tense of “do/does” which is “did”.</span></p><h2><strong>Negation with “have” (perfect tenses)</strong></h2><p><span>There is another particular method for negating verbs in perfect tenses. Here is an overview on how it works:</span></p><h3><strong>Negation with present perfect simple</strong></h3><p><span>A negative sentence in present perfect simple uses the following structure:</span></p><h4><strong>have/has + not + past participle (3rd verb form)</strong></h4><p><span>For example:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>have not been</strong><span> to Paris.</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>have not eaten</strong><span> dinner.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>has not driven</strong><span> a car.</span></p><p><span>They </span><strong>have not made</strong><span> a cake.</span></p><p><span>To make contractions, we can change the sentences as follows:</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>haven’t been</strong><span> to Paris.</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>haven’t eaten</strong><span> dinner.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>hasn’t driven</strong><span> a car.</span></p><p><span>They </span><strong>haven’t made</strong><span> a cake.</span></p><p><span>In order to create negation sentences with past present simple, we swap out “have/has” with its past tense form “had”.</span></p><h3><strong>Negation with present perfect continuous</strong></h3><p><span>In order to create a negation sentence with present perfect continuous, the following structure applies:</span></p><p><strong>have/has + not + been + gerund (-ing verb)</strong></p><p><span>For example:</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>have not been walking</strong><span> home.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>has not been making</strong><span> dinner.</span></p><p><span>You </span><strong>have not been speaking</strong><span> loud enough.</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>have not been eating</strong><span> out so often.</span></p><p><span>The same contraction rules from above apply here as well:</span></p><p><span>I </span><strong>haven’t been walking</strong><span> home.</span></p><p><span>She </span><strong>hasn’t been making</strong><span> dinner.</span></p><p><span>You </span><strong>haven’t been speaking</strong><span> loud enough.</span></p><p><span>We </span><strong>haven’t been eating</strong><span> out so often.</span></p><p><span>If we want to use past perfect continuous, we again swap out “have/has” for the past tense form “had”.</span></p><p>Improve your English skills with Lingoda and claim your free 7-day trial today!
