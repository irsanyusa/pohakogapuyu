And even if&nbsp;sometimes it’s really difficult to&nbsp;admit that your “happily ever after” just isn’t working, you shouldn’t get upset, because there are plenty of&nbsp;good things that a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> can bring into your life.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> found out 7&nbsp;reasons why it’s better to&nbsp;walk away, than to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unhealthy marriage.</p><p><h2>7. You’ll have a&nbsp;better chance to&nbsp;meet “the right one.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/755/9f4/57c5f7554dbb8bdd5e1cba4c78.jpg><p>When you’re married, you unconsciously try to&nbsp;stay away from the opposite sex, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;not make your partner jealous. This way, you miss out on&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;opportunities and great people you can make friends with. This is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;bad thing when you’re happily married. But if&nbsp;you feel that your marriage has become suffocating, <strong>a&nbsp;divorce can help you clear the way to&nbsp;meet the right partner in&nbsp;the future</strong>.</p><p>After an&nbsp;unsuccessful marriage, you have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;experience that can open the door for you to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love again and find the right person to&nbsp;spend the rest of&nbsp;your life with. In&nbsp;fact, some <a href=#>studies</a> show that <strong>people who remarry are less likely to&nbsp;get divorced</strong> because this time you know yourself better and you’re sure of&nbsp;what you’re looking for in&nbsp;your significant other.</p><p><h2>6. You can devote your energy to&nbsp;your own personal growth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/02b/65c/90f2cd59b6b7bcbc60553084db.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you stay in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unhealthy marriage for a&nbsp;long time, your emotional well-being is&nbsp;always at&nbsp;stake. <strong>This numbing pain can give you the feeling that you’ve started to&nbsp;lose yourself</strong>.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you remember your old hobbies or&nbsp;the things that used to&nbsp;bring you <a href=# title=pleasure data-link=tag>pleasure</a> a&nbsp;long time ago? Does your spouse support your decisions and worldview? Do&nbsp;you <a href=#>enjoy</a> your life at&nbsp;the moment? If&nbsp;your answers are “no,” perhaps <strong>it’s time to&nbsp;make some changes in&nbsp;your personal life</strong>.</p><p>It&nbsp;turns out that <strong>a&nbsp;bad marriage may keep you from doing the things in&nbsp;life that you want to&nbsp;do</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;having the things in&nbsp;life that you deserve. So&nbsp;after a&nbsp;divorce, you can finally stop putting all of&nbsp;your energy into a&nbsp;relationship that no&nbsp;longer works and use it&nbsp;for other important areas of&nbsp;your life.</p><p><h2>5. You’ll feel happier.</h2></p><p>When you get out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad marriage, you may lose a&nbsp;spouse but <strong>you actually gain happiness instead</strong>. Life is&nbsp;too short to&nbsp;waste it&nbsp;on&nbsp;contradictory people and unhealthy relationships. And if&nbsp;you feel that your marriage is&nbsp;only making you feel unfulfilled and unhappy, it’s definitely time to&nbsp;go.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, divorce might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;shock to&nbsp;you at&nbsp;first, but later you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;turn this page and open up&nbsp;a&nbsp;new chapter in&nbsp;your life that could be&nbsp;much more amazing than the previous one. In&nbsp;fact, some <a href=#>research</a> shows that <strong>both men and women feel happier for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;5&nbsp;years following the end of&nbsp;their marriages</strong> because they feel more content with their lives.</p><p><h2>4. Your kids will be&nbsp;happier too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/529/54b/8207925ad184de2f51dc88806c.jpg><p>Many couples realize that they are unhappy and still decide to&nbsp;stay married “for their children’s sake.” But this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;really bad idea. Your <a href=#>children</a> can hear your sarcasm and arguments and may constantly <strong>feel stressed out by&nbsp;the tension in&nbsp;your unhappy marriage</strong>.</p><p>Even more than all of&nbsp;this,<strong> </strong>they might be&nbsp;confused about what a&nbsp;<a href=# title=healthy data-link=tag>healthy</a> relationship is&nbsp;and isn’t, which can lead to&nbsp;huge problems in&nbsp;their future personal life. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;ruin your child’s psychological state, you should show them how to&nbsp;respect each other and find a&nbsp;compromise. And don’t forget the golden rule&nbsp;— <strong>a&nbsp;happy parent means a&nbsp;happy child</strong>.</p><p><h2>3. Your health might improve.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/69e/e42/e5133a57ca9659211d924839be.jpg><p>Most people believe that marriage can boost your health, but in&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bad marriage,</a> this doesn’t work at&nbsp;all. On&nbsp;the contrary, an&nbsp;<strong>unhappy, conflict-riddled marriage can be&nbsp;worse for you health-wise</strong> than being single or&nbsp;happily married.</p><p>Studies confirm that living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hostile home can be&nbsp;as&nbsp;physically <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>damaging</a> as&nbsp;too much drinking or&nbsp;chronic work stress. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you still haven’t broken up&nbsp;with your wife or&nbsp;husband who is&nbsp;not your “better half,” remember that you have an&nbsp;increased risk for heart disease, cancer, arthritis, diabetes, and a&nbsp;weaker immune system. Moreover, even <strong>small cuts and wounds on&nbsp;your skin will heal&nbsp;40% slower</strong>.</p><p><h2>2. You will start looking better.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/624/bb7/172e305367b78d3bdba2c0abf6.jpg><p>Even if&nbsp;you don’t intend to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;diet or&nbsp;start Botox-ing everything after a&nbsp;divorce, <strong>you may still notice some unexpected changes in&nbsp;your look</strong>. Lots of&nbsp;people <a href=#>admit</a> that they powerfully transformed from the inside because they started feeling better and more alive. And as&nbsp;their inner self started blossoming, their outer appearance slowly transformed for the better too.</p><p>What’s more, after a&nbsp;great life transition like a&nbsp;divorce, most people tend to&nbsp;change their outside on&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;— they start working out, buy new clothes, update their makeup, and so&nbsp;on. These <a href=#>changes</a> also help<strong> improve their self-confidence and their sense of&nbsp;well-being</strong>.</p><p><h2>1. You’ll have an&nbsp;easier retirement.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bbe/b5e/84a7675005bf0d610516a9e916.jpg><p>We&nbsp;rarely escape from a&nbsp;marriage expense-free. However, a&nbsp;divorce can actually be&nbsp;financially beneficial for you in&nbsp;the long run&nbsp;— some <a href=#>studies</a> prove that <strong>divorced women who never remarry are often better off in&nbsp;their old age</strong>.</p><p>After a&nbsp;divorce, they typically focus on&nbsp;their career and work more hours than they used to&nbsp;before. All of&nbsp;this results in&nbsp;higher lifetime earnings that help women <strong>make larger contributions to&nbsp;their retirement accounts</strong> and earn significantly larger Social Security benefits.</p><p>Have you ever gotten through a&nbsp;divorce?
