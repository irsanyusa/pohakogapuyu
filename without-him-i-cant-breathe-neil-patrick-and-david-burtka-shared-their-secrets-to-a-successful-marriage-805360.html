It’s the work both partners put into it&nbsp;that makes the marriage succeed in&nbsp;the long run.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was only through pure serendipity that Harris and Burtka met.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/020/f44/4aec8b5e709428657f2856500c.jpg><p>Neil first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>laid</a> eyes on&nbsp;his future husband in&nbsp;the year 2000, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;street corner in&nbsp;New York. He&nbsp;ran into his friend Kate, who was accompanied by&nbsp;David. Assuming that Burtka was her boyfriend,<strong> his first words to&nbsp;her were,</strong> “<strong>Nicely done</strong>.”<br></p><p>After a&nbsp;short chit-chat with his friend, Harris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> out that Burtka was gay. Burtka had a&nbsp;boyfriend at&nbsp;the time, but the universe wanted them together, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;kept setting things up&nbsp;for them to&nbsp;find their paths to&nbsp;each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e6/f16/88273c54a7856822228a21ab31.jpg><p>Neil and David <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a> to&nbsp;bump into each other on&nbsp;the periphery, but their first “real” hangout was at&nbsp;an&nbsp;<i>American Idol</i> viewing party. <strong>Neil couldn’t take his eyes off him</strong>, but he&nbsp;wasn’t the type of&nbsp;guy who would interfere in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;just hoped that the stars would eventually align.</p><p><h2>They were straightforward with each other from the begging of&nbsp;their relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/275/da7/200722503e9a8b4c67926ae7e1.jpg><p>Neil and David first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> hanging out as&nbsp;friends, and when Burtka realized that he&nbsp;liked Harris, he&nbsp;broke up&nbsp;with his long-distance boyfriend. A&nbsp;week later, they went on&nbsp;their first date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34a/e5c/652630526e9351c829b7090287.jpg><p>For David, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>having</a> kids was one of&nbsp;the most important parts of&nbsp;his future and a&nbsp;key and crucial thing when picking a&nbsp;life partner. That’s why he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;talk about whether Neil wanted kids on&nbsp;their first date. “<strong>If&nbsp;he&nbsp;hadn’t wanted kids, I&nbsp;don’t think we’d be&nbsp;together.</strong> I&nbsp;always thought that family was the most important thing in&nbsp;life, and no&nbsp;matter what I&nbsp;do, whether I’m a&nbsp;chef or&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor or&nbsp;a&nbsp;dancer, being a&nbsp;dad is&nbsp;what I&nbsp;do best.”</p><p>Today Burtka and Harris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>have</a> 2&nbsp;fraternal twins together and for the first year, David didn’t miss a&nbsp;night or&nbsp;a&nbsp;morning with them.</p><p><h2>Their relationship&nbsp;is, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, very codependent.</h2></p><p>Neil and Burtka <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> to&nbsp;hang out together every night. And every night turned into a&nbsp;non-stop thing. After only 3&nbsp;months, the couple decided to&nbsp;start living together. They revealed that they are very co-dependent&nbsp;— <strong>they talk on&nbsp;the phone at&nbsp;least 8&nbsp;times and text each other at&nbsp;least 25&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day</strong>. And as&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out, this way works great for them.</p><p>“He’s my&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lifeline</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;amazing way. <strong>Without him, I&nbsp;can’t breathe.</strong> He&nbsp;makes me&nbsp;a&nbsp;little more grounded, and&nbsp;I bring out the wild side in&nbsp;him.”</p><p><h2>Even when things are good and seem perfect, they go&nbsp;to&nbsp;couples therapy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/faa/091/80ebdf563e81a33fcc55fd2ad4.jpg><p>Patrick and David have been together for 18&nbsp;years now and they openly admit that their relationship is&nbsp;far from perfect. Burtka revealed that <strong>going to&nbsp;couples therapy </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>helped</strong></a><strong> their relationship thrive</strong>. “We&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;couples therapy. Not that there’s anything wrong, but it’s nice to&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;just talk to&nbsp;someone who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mediator.”</p><p><h2>They believe that a&nbsp;relationship changes over time and they just go&nbsp;with the flow.</h2></p><p>Burtka and Harris don’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pretend</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect couple, nor do&nbsp;they want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“the poster boys for gay relationships,” even though <strong>they believe they have the perfect recipe for a&nbsp;wonderful relationship</strong>. “We’re just trying&nbsp;— in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good, positive, loving way&nbsp;— to&nbsp;live our lives,” Burtka revealed.</p><p>Neil admitted that, like in&nbsp;every marriage, he&nbsp;and his husband <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fight</a>, but they try to&nbsp;keep their fights short and get over them as&nbsp;quickly as&nbsp;possible. After they had kids together, Patrick also revealed that they rarely have big fights. “<strong>What’s the point? We’re in&nbsp;this for a&nbsp;major long haul.</strong>”</p><p><h2>For Patrick, perseverance is&nbsp;the thing that makes the relationship last.</h2></p><p>The first 3&nbsp;years of&nbsp;their relationship were the honeymoon phase. Ever since, they’ve put a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;work into maintaining their relationship. When Harris was asked in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview what the secret is&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-lasting relationship, his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reply</a> was, “I&nbsp;think the secret to&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship is&nbsp;just perseverance, you know? <strong>It’s not always pretty... but he’s pretty, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;easy.</strong>”</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have any secrets for a&nbsp;successful marriage?
