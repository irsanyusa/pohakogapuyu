Warm, comforting, and such a simple idea that it’s hard to believe they’ve only recently become popular, their only issue is that there’s so many out there, it can be tough to know where to start. To help you figure it out, we’ve rounded up the best weighted blankets for every occasion.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-weighted-blanket>How to choose the best weighted blanket</h2><p>If you’re trying to decide on a weighted blanket, consider the following criteria:</p><h3>Size</h3><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Dr. Shelby Harris</a>, licensed clinical psychologist and board certified sleep specialist, recommends choosing a weighted blanket that weighs roughly 10% of your body weight, and is either full size (for maximum body pressure) or a little smaller (for targeted areas).</p><h3>Material</h3><p>“The material of the outer cover and inner filling is crucial,” warns Mariya Snisar, head of interior design at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Renowell</a>. “Common options include cotton, minky fabric, microfiber, and cooling fabrics. Opt for a breathable material if you tend to sleep hot, and check the filler material, ensuring even distribution and secure stitching.”</p><h3>Ease of cleaning</h3><p>“Weighted blankets are usually filled with materials such as glass beads, plastic pellets, steel beads, or grains like rice and buckwheat,” explains Byron Golub, vice president of product and merchandising at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Saatva</a>. “Cleaning a weighted blanket can be challenging since many of them cannot be washed in a washing machine due to their high weight and the nature of the materials. Therefore, it's essential to know how to properly clean them to avoid any damage.”</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-weighted-blankets>Our top picks for the best weighted blankets</h2><h3>Most comfortable weighted blanket: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Threshold Microplush Weighted Blanket</a></h3><p>Even the <a rel=alternate href=#>best comforters</a> need a little extra help sometimes, so for a really cozy addition, try Threshold’s microplush offering. “This weighted blanket offers full coverage with a comfortable touch,” says Snisar. “You’ll enjoy it greatly as it keeps you warm during the chilly months.” As a bonus, it has a removable cover for easier washing.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Care instructions: Cover is machine washable</li><li>Weight: 15 pounds</li><li>Fill material: 91% glass beads, 9% polyester</li><li>Shell material: Microplush</li><li>Sizes: 55 inches x 80 inches</li><li>Colors: Four</li><li>Return policy: Free 90-day returns</li><li>Price on Publish: $95.11</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Removable cover</li><li>Super soft</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some customer reviews complain about pilling after washing</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An exceptionally comfortable, warm, weighted blanket for those who like to snuggle.</p><p><span class=best-for>Most comfortable weighted blanket</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Threshold Microplush Weighted Blanket</h3></p><h3>Best value weighted blanket: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Zonli Heated Weighted Blanket</a></h3><p>For those looking to get their money’s worth, Zonli’s weighted blanket is a must-have.

This option, recommended by Harris, weighs in at just nine pounds, making it a good option for older kids. Harris also likes the fact that it’s, “cozy and breathable, with secure ties to stay put.” It’s also made with “clean” ingredients—and if that is a priority for you, consult our guides to the <a rel=alternate href=#>best organic mattresses</a>, <a rel=alternate href=#>best organic sheets</a>, and <a rel=alternate href=#>best organic pillows</a> for an eco-conscious bedroom.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Care instructions: Machine washable and dryer safe</li><li>Weight: Nine pounds</li><li>Fill material: Glass microbeads</li><li>Shell material: Cotton</li><li>Sizes: 40 inches x 60 inches</li><li>Colors: Petal pink, aqua, indigo</li><li>Return policy: 30 day returns</li><li>Price on Publish: $149</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Child-friendly</li><li>Machine washable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Still too heavy for younger kids</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A soft, machine washable weighted blanket that, at just nine pounds, is suitable for older kids.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best weighted blanket for kids</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Baloo Living The Mini</h3></p><h3>Best budget weighted blanket: <a rel=nofollow href=#>YnM Weighted Blanket</a></h3><p>For an inexpensive option, it’s tough to do better than this weighted blanket from YnM.

That’s why this one is a good option for those looking for easy maintenance: “It has the option of purchasing a <a rel=nofollow href=#>removable, machine washable cover</a>, making cleaning a breeze,” says Harris.

This overall sense of calmness leads to more restful sleep.”</p><h2 id=tips-for-washing-care-and-maintaining-weighted-blankets>Tips for washing, care, and maintaining weighted blankets</h2><p>“Every weighted blanket is unique,” says Golub. “They are made of different materials and vary in weight, requiring different types of care. To properly clean your weighted blanket, it is essential to read the care label and follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions.”</p><h3>Washing technique</h3><p>“If your weighted blanket weighs 15 pounds or more, it will likely not fit in your home washing machine and could potentially damage it,” warns Golub. “In this case, it’s recommended to go to a laundromat and use a commercial washing machine. That said, there are often instances when you can spot-clean your blanket with a solution of warm water and mild detergent as needed. For weighted blankets that can be put into a washing machine, you should take special care and only use cool water and a gentle cycle, as materials like plastic poly beads inside the blanket could melt or warp if the water is too hot.”</p><h3>Frequency</h3><p>“The frequency of cleaning your weighted blanket depends on how often you use it and whether or not you use a barrier such as a cover,” says Golub. “If you use your blanket daily and it comes into direct contact with your body, washing it once every few weeks is recommended to prevent the buildup of sweat and body oils. However, if you don't use your weighted blanket frequently, or use a sheet as a barrier between your body and the blanket, then once a season should be sufficient. It's important to keep in mind that washing your weighted blanket too often can impact its feel and durability. To extend the life of your blanket, consider investing in a cover that can be easily removed and washed.”</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the best weighted blanket material?</h3><p>“Cotton is a breathable and natural fabric, making it a popular choice for weighted blankets,” says Snisar. “It allows for good air circulation, preventing you from feeling too hot. Another popular material for weighted blankets is minky. This plush, soft fabric provides a cozy and tactile experience, making it suitable for individuals who enjoy a softer texture.”</p><h3>Who shouldn’t use a weighted blanket?</h3><p>“Avoid weighted blankets if you have sleep apnea, are pregnant, or have certain medical conditions, and always prioritize safety over comfort,” says Harris.</p><p>“Individuals who experience claustrophobia or have a strong aversion to feeling confined may find the added weight uncomfortable,” adds Snisar. “Individuals with medical conditions such as respiratory or circulatory issues should exercise caution using a weighted blanket as the added pressure could affect breathing or circulation.”</p><p>“Weighted blankets and weighted sacks are not recommended for babies,” warns Golub. “The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2022 revised its sleep recommendations and included in the statement that weighted blankets are not considered safe for babies. Weighted sacks can lead to overheating, which is a known risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). There is a concern that if a baby rolls, they may not be able to roll back, which can lead to suffocation.”</p><h3>Which weighted blankets are best for kids?</h3><p>“The 10% of your body weight rule applies to children and adults in terms of finding the best option,” says Golub. “Weighted blankets shouldn’t be used by anyone who can’t move freely beneath the weight. Because weighted blankets come in limited weight options, it’s best to err on the side of being lighter to avoid any risks or mobility issues.”</p><h3>Do weighted blankets make you hot?</h3><p>“Whether a weighted blanket makes you hot can depend on various factors, including the materials used in the blanket, the climate, and individual preferences,” says Snisar. “Many weighted blankets are made with breathable materials such as cotton or a blend of fabrics to help regulate temperature.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lp5q2qLTTnptmmpyWu6yx02g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
