After receiving a&nbsp;life-saving kidney transplant, a&nbsp;man discovered that his anonymous donor was none other than his own daughter. Grateful yet concerned, the man’s emotions reflect the powerful bond between a&nbsp;father and daughter. Read on&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn more about their story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d66/2be/ee8bd457979a203c3ae3b94fcb.jpg><p>2&nbsp;years ago, John Ivanowski <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>received</a> a&nbsp;life-changing diagnosis: IgA nephropathy, a&nbsp;chronic kidney disease with potentially devastating consequences. As&nbsp;the disease progressed, Ivanowski refused to&nbsp;let it&nbsp;defeat him.</p><p>Johns Hopkins Medicine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>warned</a> that IgA nephropathy, the chronic illness Ivanowski was diagnosed with, can eventually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lead</a> to&nbsp;end-stage renal disease. At&nbsp;this point, the kidneys are no&nbsp;longer able to&nbsp;function, leaving patients with limited options. With this grim prognosis, it’s inspiring to&nbsp;see how Ivanowski has refused to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;hope and is&nbsp;fighting to&nbsp;live his best life.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;also didn’t want his loved ones to&nbsp;worry about him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df1/dab/e300265e7bb30f69e537411631.jpg><p>Delayne Ivanowski was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>informed</a> by&nbsp;doctors that her father had limited time left to&nbsp;live due to&nbsp;his illness. Recognizing that her dad urgently needed a&nbsp;transplant, Ivanowski was motivated to&nbsp;assist him in&nbsp;any way possible. Despite her father’s objections, Ivanowski remained steadfast in&nbsp;her decision to&nbsp;donate a&nbsp;kidney to&nbsp;him.</p><p>Her selflessness and determination came to&nbsp;fruition on&nbsp;Feb.&nbsp;16, as&nbsp;she gave her father the gift of&nbsp;life. For 9&nbsp;months, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>underwent</a> the necessary testing and procedures to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;donor, all while keeping her plans a&nbsp;closely guarded secret.</p><p><h2>Despite his gratitude for his daughter’s selflessness, the Missouri father was also worried for her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a34/074/ac2f16567aab8b05cdfd9c89d8.jpg><p>The father was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>apprehensive</a> about the potential physical risks of&nbsp;her donating a&nbsp;kidney. The loss of&nbsp;his son to&nbsp;cancer more than 15&nbsp;years ago added to&nbsp;his concerns, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “I&nbsp;thought, I&nbsp;lost my&nbsp;boy and if&nbsp;anything happened to&nbsp;Delayne, I&nbsp;don’t know what&nbsp;I would&nbsp;do.”</p><p>Despite her father’s initial opposition, Ivanowski was determined to&nbsp;help him, as&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “I’m not good at&nbsp;being told&nbsp;no.” Eventually, she received approval as&nbsp;a&nbsp;donor and the <a href=# title=surgery data-link=tag>surgery</a> was scheduled for Oct.&nbsp;30, 2022. However, the procedure was delayed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>due to</a>&nbsp;an&nbsp;accident in&nbsp;which John Ivanowski fell out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tree while setting up&nbsp;a&nbsp;deer stand and was injured.</p><p><h2>Per the plan, the transplant surgery was carried out on&nbsp;Feb.&nbsp;16, 2023, without complications.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ce7/12f/49ed1152139488645fdb5d11af.png><p>The day after the surgery, Ivanowski <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>entered</a> her father’s recovery room, still wearing her gown and attached to&nbsp;an&nbsp;IV, to&nbsp;surprise him with the good news.
