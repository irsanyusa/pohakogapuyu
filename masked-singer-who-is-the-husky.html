But one of the contestants is coming in to cool things down. The Husky takes the stage on Elton John Night and looks like he’s quite the commanding presence.</strong></p><p>But will he make it out of Elton John Night? And who is the celebrity under the mask? Let’s go through everything we know about the Husky so far.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl2b4YTptwM</p>The Husky performs “Bennie and the Jets” on The Masked Singer Elton John Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 10</h2><p>On the Season 10 Kickoff and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube Shorts</a>, we got the first clue about the identity of the Husky. In a deep voice, the Husky said “Don’t go barking up the wrong tree. Listen, here’s 10 million hints at who I am.” He then unveiled a $10 million bill. That’s all the clues we’ve gotten ahead of the Husky’s first time taking the stage on Elton John Night.</p><p>In the Husky’s clues, he starts by saying huskies are energetic, aware, and loving, just like him! We see a snowball with a crying emoji superimposed over it roll onto the screen. When he first “hit the scene,” the female species would shower him with love “and sometimes, their under things.”</p><p>Despite all the attention, he was a family dog. He approached a carousel. Then, we see him dancing with Mother Nature from The Masked Singer, who was previously revealed to be Vivica A. Fox. Now, he’s ready to bring his talent to this stage! We see a chocolate bar in the snow before the end of his clues. Then, after his performance, the Men in Black bring out a rocket. Husky explains, “I skyrocketed up the charts and landed on this platinum album.”</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO’S PERFORMING ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 10 PREMIERE?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Husky</h2><p>Jenny was picking up on the crying face emoji, thinking the Husky could be Baby Face. But Robin thought she was “barking up the wrong tree,” predicting it’s Terrence Howard. Ken guessed it could be Morris Chestnut. In the comments, fans have a lot of thoughts about who the Husky could be. Some are predicting rapper Chamillionaire, Mario, Nelly, Usher, Sisqo, and Ginuwine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Husky on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>I loved the Nelly prediction, since he was recently on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With the Stars</a>, but unfortunately the clues point another direction. Based on his voice and what we know so far, the Husky has to be…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ginuwine>Ginuwine!</h3><p>With the judges mentioning he’s tall, Ginuwine fits the bill at 6’2″ tall! But there are plenty of other clues that line up too. The crying emoji, despite what Jenny said, is a nod to his name because it has WHINE in it. He also has a song called “Two Reasons I Cry,” which could explain it. His story about fans throwing “under things” on stage also aligns with stories that Ginuwine has told before.</p><p>Ginuwine is also, indeed, a family man. In fact, he has 9 kids! And he also has a connection to Vivica A. Fox because the two were in the movie Juwanna Mann together. There are also a few references to some of his music and movie roles. We saw a carousel for “Pony,” he mentioned huskies being “majestic” which points to his “Three Kings” album, and the chocolate bar is for his movie “Chocolate City.” Finally, the Husky mentioned “skyrocketing up the charts to a platinum album” and Ginuwine has released a number of platinum albums in his career.</p><p>If you’ve missed The Masked Singer, you missed FIVE great contestants in Group B!
