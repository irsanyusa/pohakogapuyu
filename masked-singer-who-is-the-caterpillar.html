We’ve seen the tallest costume ever, the Octopus, the biggest costume ever, the Baby, and now the longest costume ever, the Caterpillar! This energetic, braces-wearing Wildcard joined Group B and he is here to WIN!</strong></p><p>But how far can the Caterpillar make it? And who is the celebrity under the mask? We’re going to break down all the clues and make our prediction.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-bba56fdc-1613-4f63-a943-7d4ef6fb3cee>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 6</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-826093eb-7e1a-4dd7-a946-3dce54548dda><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;GROUP B PREMIERE RECAP + OUR PREDICTION FOR THE BABY</a></strong></p><p>Before the season, during a sneak peek, the Caterpillar said, “you might not know who I am yet, but I could say a Taylor would,” alluding to Taylor Swift. In the <a href=#>Caterpillar’s clues</a>, he kicks off saying that he chose the Caterpillar because his life “has been all about metamorphosis.” He turns on a TV and claims that he was lonely growing up. A hurricane is shown on the TV screen. “Things weren’t always great at home” so he “left home at a young age.” He says he lived in his car, was homeless, and even started stealing to make ends meet. Caterpillar is shown grabbing a basketball that then sparks fireworks and catches on fire.</p><p>His parents used to tell him that he’d end up in jail, “and boy, were they right.” Caterpillar is shown behind bars with two police officers handcuffing him. The thing that drove him the most was “all those voices from [his] past,” telling him he’d “never amount to anything.” We see a framed photo of the Great Lakes in gold.</p><p>After his first performance, the Caterpillar revealed a few things in a “Speed Dating” segment. He says he’s “probably” ghosted someone, he’d be the worst at “asking rapid fire questions, he’s been cheated on before, he prefers texts over calls, and he de-stresses by getting dressed up in a Caterpillar costume! Caterpillar would take Robin on a date, because he “can’t take [his] eyes off all his printed shirts.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-aed0ca83-5ae3-4549-9411-272b33f78a6d>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Caterpillar</h2><p>Robin predicted that this could be a member of the Backstreet Boys, maybe Howie D. Ken thought it could be Aaron Carter. Jenny also thought it could be a boy bander, maybe AJ McLean from the Backstreet Boys. which Robin then agreed with.</p><p>Online, guesses for the caterpillar have been all over the place. Many think it could be a former boy band member, like AJ McLean or Howie D from the Backstreet Boys, Justin Jeffre or Jeff Timmons from 98 Degrees, or Nick Carter’s brother, Aaron Carter. A lot of people have also guessed Sam Smith, Scott Hoying from Pentatonix, Andy Grammer, Brendon Urie from Panic! At the Disco, Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy, or Corey Taylor from Slipknot. So as you can tell, there’s a lot of confusion about the Caterpillar’s identity!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-dbd3758a-2c07-4407-884a-af68d22f49c4>Who is the Caterpillar on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>This has been one of the trickiest celebrities to predict this season. The voice sounds so familiar, but most of the popular guesses don’t line up with the clues. So doing our research, we found the answer. And it’s not someone that anyone else is predicting the Caterpillar to be!</p><p>So with that, the Caterpillar is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eb4a6776-9b31-44f2-8abe-d267d1b20c62>Bobby Berk from Queer Eye<strong>!</strong></h2><p>That’s right! All the clues line up perfectly and Bobby has mentioned that singing is his “hidden talent” and he’d like to release an album. Well, this seems like the perfect way to launch a music career! Let’s see how the lines point to him.</p><p>The clue about Taylor Swift knowing who he is is one of the easiest ones to connect, and what initially drew me to him. Bobby appeared in Taylor’s “You Need to Calm Down” music video with the rest of the Fab Five from Queer Eye. Life being about metamorphosis also makes sense, since that’s the premise of Queer Eye. His childhood was also rough. Bobby Berk left home at 15 and was homeless, living in his car or with friends. He’s originally from Houston, which might explain the hurricane clue.</p><p>As Robin mentioned, the basketball does point to BB, but those are Bobby Berk’s initials, not the Backstreet Boys. Bobby has been arrested as well, for disorderly conduct, driving without a license, and receiving stolen property. That explains the stealing comment too! The Great Lakes could be a nod to the fact that Bobby lives in the Silver Lake neighborhood of LA. And lastly, he gave a big clue when talking to Robin. He said he can’t take his EYE off all his printed shirts, referring to Queer Eye and his role as a designer on it.</p><p id=block-b059d09d-9b41-40c0-a5c4-c7c0ffec307f>Do you agree with our prediction?
