The supermodel and rapper have reportedly broken up after 10 months of being together.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kendall-jenner-bad-bunny-split-after-10-months-together>Kendall Jenner, Bad Bunny Split After 10 Months Together</h2><p>An insider told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> that Jenner and Bad Bunny have decided to call it quits ahead of the new year. At the time of the initial report, no particular reason for their breakup was cited. Now though, other insiders are speaking up, telling what the real reason of the split might be.</p><p>Recently, an unnamed source told ET that Jenner and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bad Bunny</a> have been busy doing their own businesses and “things slowly started to fizzle out between them.”</p><p>“They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn’t be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go,” the source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “They have crazy busy schedules and know they’re still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.”</p><p>In addition, the source said that there “isn’t any negativity between them and they still want the best for one another.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">supermodel</a> and Puerto Rican superstar first sparked romance rumors in February. Fans began speculating about their relationship status after they were seen joining <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailey Bieber</a> and Justin Bieber on a double. During that time, an insider reported that they were introduced after Bad Bunny moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>Since late October, the pair hadn’t been seen bonding together. This was when Jenner supported the rapper at his Saturday Night Live hosting debut in New York City. On December 16, The supermodel was spotted having fun with friends in Aspen, Colorado, without Bad Bunny. &nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-reports-say-her-family-doesn-t-have-anything-against-the-rapper>Reports Say Her Family Doesn’t Have Anything Against the Rapper</h2><p>Despite the pair’s alleged breakup, Jenner’s family is reportedly cool about the split. The source stated that the supermodel’s relatives don’t have any bad blood against the musician.</p><p>“Kendall’s family still thinks highly of him,” the source said. “They just want her to be with whoever makes her happy, treats her with love and respect, and someone that understands and can handle the attention that comes along with dating her with poise and grace.”</p><p>Although their relationship was inevitably made known to the public, Jenner and Bad Bunny made efforts to keep their relationship private. Previously, however, the socialite shared her belief when it comes to love.</p><p>“I love really hard, and I love without apology,” she told Harper’s Bazaar in an interview published August. “I don’t like goodbyes, and I will fight to not have to say goodbye, I will always fight for relationships. I’ve been that way since I was little, although I was shy and sometimes very closed off,”</p><p>“I don’t give up on anything. Some people aren’t willing to meet me at that level,” she added. “But that’s okay. I’d rather do that than shut myself off to something and not give it a proper chance.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_OliviaRodrigo_LouisPartridge-220x147.jpg alt="Olivia Rodrigo, Louis Partridge Spotted Enjoying a Romantic Outing in The Catskills" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>bad bunny</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kendall Jenner</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6lnZmcoXqrsc2nnKtlkpaxbq7Up6WyZaKavbC%2B056bpbFdl7%2BmrcpmrKllkZvBpr6MpZysq12ptaK6jJpksp2Rp3qwsoydmK2hnpx8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
