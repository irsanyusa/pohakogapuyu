With a new season around the corner, so much tea has leaked from the prerecorded tapings. Eight Golden Buzzers, a deadly prank, Simon Cowell’s onset disaster, a wardrobe malfunction, and trouble in paradise without David Walliams.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Before we begin, we need to address the elephant in the room. David Walliams is no longer on the BGT judging panel. If you missed it, the comedian was asked to leave the show after his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">disrespectful comments</a> surfaced online. Former Strictly Come Dancing and current Dancing With the Stars judge Bruno Tonioli has officially taken his place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everything-that-leaked-before-britain-s-got-talent-s-2023-premiere>Everything That Leaked Before Britain’s Got Talent’s 2023 Premiere</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bruno Tonioli Reportedly Caused Riffs Between Judges</h3><p>Even though the returning BGT judges were excited to meet Tonioli, it quickly leaked that he was causing some tension on set. Since it’s been revealed that he never saw the show before accepting the job, it’s not surprise that he broke the rules. In addition, female judges were upset that he was offered their estimated salary, as a newcomer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Simon Cowell Almost DIES?</h3><p>If you’ve seen “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell Dead</a>” trending, this is probably why. Apparently, Cowell took part in a magic trick, that could’ve been deadly. A unnamed magician reportedly put a box on the judges head, doused it in lighter fluid, then set him on fire.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Amanda Holden Has a Cheeky Wardrobe Malfunction</h3><p>BGT longtime judge Amanda Holden had an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction behind the scenes of auditions. While donning a pink bodycon dress, the celebrity’s microphone pack slid all the way down her back, into her butt.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Simon Cowell Pranks the New Judge</h3><p>The longtime Got Talent judge decided to welcome in Tonioli, with the ultimate prank. If you’re a fan of America’s Got Talent, you probably remember his crossbow arrow prank on Sofia Vergara in 2020. Reportedly, Cowell is set to prank Tonioli in a similar fashion, and the audience was freaked out.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>There Will be Eight Golden Buzzers This Season</h3><p>This season will truly be one of a kind. Since Tonioli came in and “broke all the rules” It’s been confirmed that Tonioli hit his Golden Buzzer twice, so Cowell decided to hit his twice as well.</p><p>“I leapt at the opportunity and thought, ‘I’m going to make it even more chaotic now,’ and pressed mine again,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. “Then the audience were all screaming for a particular amazing act so I thought, ‘Who cares? Let’s press it again,’ and we ended up with eight golden buzzers!”</p><p>Now, it’s been revealed that there will be a Group Golden Buzzer in addition to each judge and their hosts Golden Buzzers. Fans should expect to see Tonioli and Cowell hit their Golden Buzzers twice, while Holden, Alesha Dixon, and Ant and Dec will hit theirs once. This will be the first time the Group Golden Buzzer has ever appeared on the show, so fans are very excited to see the moment.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_ValChmerkovskiy_JennaJohnson-220x147.jpg alt="‘DWTS’ Pro Val Chmerkovskiy Honors His First Son Rome with New Tattoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKWjZqyYmnqtscCknJ1lmaOzsHnAm6aurF2Xv6rAwKKlrGWXpMFuwMClnKesXWd9c3%2BMsJ%2BarF2pvG64zqiiZp6fp8SivsNmq6hn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
