This article will show you unbelievable examples of&nbsp;animals adopting the cubs of&nbsp;other species and it&nbsp;just might touch your heart.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>collected 18&nbsp;touching examples for you proving that a&nbsp;caregiver’s love doesn’t have any boundaries in&nbsp;size or&nbsp;species.</p><p><h2>18. Albert the sheep and Themba the elephant</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e7a/383/c7eb2a5649930fadf03295bc9e.jpg><p>After 6-month-old <a href=# title=elephant data-link=tag>elephant</a> cub Themba was orphaned and left by&nbsp;her herd, the workers of&nbsp;Shamwari Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in&nbsp;South Africa decided to&nbsp;save her life.<strong> At&nbsp;first, Albert the sheep was a&nbsp;little aggressive toward this stranger, but later his heart melted and he&nbsp;became the baby elephant’s friend and mentor.</strong></p><p><h2>17. Owen the hippo and Mzee the turtle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/301/e90/9335bb52eb97bd9b2d103c1f6c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Kenya, a&nbsp;little baby hippo was saved after being isolated from his family during a&nbsp;severe tsunami. <strong>The 650-pound cub was given the name Owen and was placed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;aviary with a&nbsp;130-year-old turtle named Mzee. </strong>At&nbsp;first, Mzee didn’t like its new neighbor, but later Mzee turned into Owen’s mentor for 2&nbsp;years. The story of&nbsp;this couple is&nbsp;so&nbsp;famous that several <a href=#>books </a>and a&nbsp;<a href=#>website </a>have been dedicated to&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>16. Sai Mai the tigress and her piglets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/255/2e6/a8b7495d53bc55bd4cd8f86f14.jpg><p>A&nbsp;tigress in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Thai zoo that once was nurtured by&nbsp;a&nbsp;pig, <a href=#>became a&nbsp;mother</a> to&nbsp;several piglets <strong>after she had lost her own babies</strong> that were born premature.</p><p><h2>15. Niv the macaque monkey and a&nbsp;chicken</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a69/1cb/3a7d935f92a2e385b2b042952c.jpg><p>A&nbsp;black macaque monkey named Niv lives in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Israeli zoo in&nbsp;the city of&nbsp;Ramat Gan. Niv couldn’t find a&nbsp;companion among its own species and <a href=#>started taking care</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=chicken data-link=tag>chicken</a> from a&nbsp;neighboring cage. <strong>Niv coddles the bird that always runs to&nbsp;him when it’s feeling scared and is&nbsp;seeking shelter</strong>. Sometimes, the bird even stays overnight.</p><p><h2>14. Tita the cat and a&nbsp;squirrel cub</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16c/42a/e60be55a9294e3a4c6e9c9ef2e.jpg><p>A&nbsp;resident of&nbsp;Colombia, Ruben Gaviria, <strong>rescued a&nbsp;wounded squirrel cub and presented it&nbsp;to&nbsp;his <a href=# title=cat data-link=tag>cat</a> that was breastfeeding her own kittens at&nbsp;the time</strong>. The cat accepted the squirrel as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her own and the squirrel got his strength back pretty quickly.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, this is&nbsp;not the first known case of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat nursing a&nbsp;squirrel. There was another case where a&nbsp;squirrel cub named Rocky was nursed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat named Emma. And she even taught him to&nbsp;<a href=#>purr like a&nbsp;cat</a>.</p><p><h2>13. Kamunyak the lioness and oryx calves</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f62/0dc/f038fc5a1c82dc0c534d59713e.jpg><p>The lioness Kamunyak (’blessed one’) has <a href=#>adopted </a><strong>about 6&nbsp;oryx calves since she had killed the mother of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the cubs during a&nbsp;hunt</strong>. The lioness couldn’t breastfeed the weak calves so&nbsp;she called on&nbsp;humans for help. She let them feed the babies under her guidance. Unfortunately, the lioness couldn’t protect all “her calves” from being attacked by&nbsp;another lions’ pride.</p><p><h2>12. Marquis the cat and puppies</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4bc/f1b/f15813512ca37d63853a0fc707.jpg><p>A&nbsp;brave cat rescued 6&nbsp;<a href=# title=puppies data-link=tag>puppies</a> last winter in&nbsp;Anapa.<strong> Not only did she keep them warm, but she was also catching mice for them to&nbsp;eat</strong>. A&nbsp;big family was accidentally discovered by&nbsp;volunteers and today both puppies and the cat have found their forever homes.</p><p><h2>11. Ruby the dog and ’Edgar’s mission’</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e2/686/4da53c5cbaa48d6cbcc0145989.jpg><p>There are many amazing animals living in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Australian center called <a href=#>’Edgar’s mission.’</a><strong> This center rescues animals that have suffered from harsh abuse by&nbsp;humans or&nbsp;that have inborn illnesses</strong>. <a href=#>Ruby </a>the dog lives there among these animals. Her first owner bought her to&nbsp;guard his sheep but soon figured out that the dog couldn’t perform this task and asked his friend to&nbsp;shoot the dog. At&nbsp;the last moment, the friend took Ruby to ’Edgar’s Mission.’ Ruby has been living at&nbsp;the center since 2009 and has helped many orphaned cubs adjust and get back to&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal life. She became a&nbsp;mother to&nbsp;piglets, calves, a&nbsp;pony, etc. Ruby performs the job of&nbsp;a&nbsp;true vet nurse at&nbsp;the center.</p><p><h2>10. DoDo the chimpanzee and Aorn the tiger cub</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c1/a7b/5de89e5053b833123b7854e871.jpg><p>DoDo&nbsp;— a&nbsp;2-year-old chimpanzee from Samut Prakan Crocodile Farm and Zoo in&nbsp;Bangkok became friends with a&nbsp;tiger cub and started to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;it. <strong>The monkey became a&nbsp;real stand-in parent for the little tiger</strong> and was even feeding milk from a&nbsp;bottle to&nbsp;Aorn, completely unaware that this little creature will soon grow into a&nbsp;huge predator.</p><p><h2>9. Summer the rabbit and kittens</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e8a/a1d/51d429528497c2fc57b5369bc4.jpg><p>When a&nbsp;veterinary nurse brought home 6&nbsp;orphaned kittens, she didn’t expect her rabbit Summer to&nbsp;befriend them. Thinking that Summer was their mother,<strong> the kittens started to&nbsp;climb all over her trying to&nbsp;nurse</strong>. Though the rabbit couldn’t help nurse them, still she became a&nbsp;good friend to&nbsp;the kittens.</p><p><h2>8. Bonedigger the lion and Milo the dachshund</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;lioness rejected her lion cub at&nbsp;the Exotic Animal Park in&nbsp;Wynnewood, Oklahoma. As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned out later, she did it&nbsp;because of&nbsp;her osteoporosis and <strong>the workers of&nbsp;the zoo decided to&nbsp;move the baby to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different spot in&nbsp;the zoo with Milo the dachshund</strong>. Milo took the her new <a href=#>job</a> of&nbsp;raising a&nbsp;lion cub very seriously. Additionally, 2&nbsp;more dachshunds were involved in&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;Bonedigger and they also managed to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;common language with the lion.</p><p><h2>7. Noah the pigeon and rabbits</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;orphaned rabbits were brought to&nbsp;a&nbsp;rehabilitation center in&nbsp;Texas after a&nbsp;dog attack.<strong> A&nbsp;pigeon</strong> named Noah, who also needed treatment, was already there and <strong>started to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the little rabbits</strong>. The rabbits grew strong quickly and since then Noah has been entrusted to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby deer and a&nbsp;baby squirrel.</p><p><h2>6. Pretinha the dog and opossum cubs</h2></p><p>After their family was attacked in&nbsp;Brazil, these newborn opossums, that hadn’t even opened their eyes yet, were orphaned. Fortunately, they were discovered in&nbsp;time and taken to&nbsp;pet behaviorist Stephanie Maldonado. But even she was unable to&nbsp;provide them with the necessary care because<strong> opossums are supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fed every 2&nbsp;hours</strong>. That’s when her dog Pretinha came to&nbsp;the rescue&nbsp;— not only was she feeding them and keeping them warm, but she was also <a href=#>carrying </a>them on&nbsp;her back.</p><p><h2>5. A&nbsp;herd of&nbsp;cows and Johann the wild boar piglet</h2></p><p></p><p>A&nbsp;small wild boar piglet found a&nbsp;home among dairy cows at&nbsp;a&nbsp;farm on&nbsp;the outskirts of&nbsp;Hamburg, Germany. The farmer, Jochen Kraft, has named the piglet Johann and <strong>admits that he&nbsp;fits in&nbsp;with his new cow family very well</strong>. The cows nudge the piglet gently with their heads and are very friendly with him. It’s likely that Johann lost his family, but luckily he&nbsp;found a&nbsp;new one. And this is&nbsp;not the first case where cows have taken care of&nbsp;wild boars.</p><p><h2>4. Ingo the German Shepherd and Poldi the owlet</h2></p><p><strong>An&nbsp;owlet named Poldi hatched much later than its brothers and sisters </strong>and was very vulnerable in&nbsp;its wild environment. It&nbsp;found its way to&nbsp;Tanja Brandt’s, a&nbsp;photographer from Germany, and not only did he&nbsp;guarantee his survival but he&nbsp;also found a&nbsp;good friend&nbsp;— a&nbsp;German Shepherd named Ingo. Their owner continues to&nbsp;take some very<a href=#> cute photos </a>of&nbsp;this unusual couple.</p><p><h2>3. Koko the gorilla and kittens</h2></p><p>Not only is&nbsp;the gorilla Koko famous around the world because <strong>she learned more than a&nbsp;thousand words in&nbsp;sign language, </strong>but also because of&nbsp;her love for kittens. Koko herself couldn’t become a&nbsp;mother, but she <a href=#>shared </a>her motherly love with purring kittens for several years.</p><p><h2>2. Kapa and Asya the pugs and tiger cubs</h2></p><p>2&nbsp;pugs adopted 4&nbsp;tiger cubs at&nbsp;Oktyabrsky Health Resort Zoo in&nbsp;Sochi, Russia. <strong>The </strong><strong>tigers</strong><strong> had already been rejected by&nbsp;their mom </strong>who had rejected her other offspring twice. Not only did the dogs help their own puppies grow strong, but also their striped adoptees.</p><p><h2>1. Sperm whales and a&nbsp;dolphin</h2></p><p></p><p>Amazing cases of&nbsp;adoption happen in&nbsp;the underwater world too. A&nbsp;family of&nbsp;sperm whales that were taking care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dolphin with a&nbsp;deformed spine had been spotted near the Azores. It’s likely that <strong>it&nbsp;was hard for the dolphin to&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;with its relatives</strong>, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;remained alone and vulnerable until a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;sperm whales adopted it&nbsp;and started to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Gary the capybara and Flopsy the cat</h2></p><p>This couple doesn’t have a&nbsp;story that includes a&nbsp;miraculous salvation or&nbsp;upbringing, but <strong>they do&nbsp;have a&nbsp;strong friendship </strong>that appeared after their owners fell in&nbsp;love with capybaras and decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>bring one of&nbsp;them home</a>. How could anyone stay indifferent after watching this 100-pound rodent get lovey-dovey with a&nbsp;kitten?</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these stories touched your heart the most? Why?
