The father-son duo played uncle and nephew on ninth episode of the series.</strong></p><p>Isaiah Crews is following in his father’s footsteps in the Nickelodeon series, Side Hustle. The series follows the main characters, Lex (Jules LeBlanc), Presley (Jayden Bartels), and Munchy (Isaiah Crews). The plotline follows the kids after they find themselves in a sticky situation. They destroyed Munchy’s dad’s boat, so they’re being are forced to earn money to pay for the damages. With the help of Munchy’s brother, they’re able to create an app to seek small jobs on. Throughout the series they figure out little ways to earn the money back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-father-son-duo-share-the-screen-on-nickelodeon-comedy>Father-Son Duo Share the Screen on Nickelodeon Comedy</h2><p>The most recent episode of the series is called “Return of Uncle Nedward.” It follows the kids and Uncle Nedward’s attempt to block the town’s decision to demolish Ol’ Cliffy, a giant mountain. The kids and Uncle Nedward are determined to put a stop to it. Terry Crews returned to his role as Uncle Nedward after guest starring in one episode of the series in March 2021.</p><p>The kids were under the impression that Uncle Nedward was living on the mountain, which is why they were concerned about it getting taken down. When the kids went to check out the mountain, they met up once again with Munchy’s Uncle Nedward.</p><p>Both Crews and his son shared previews of the episode to their Instagram pages. Some videos featured the kids meeting Uncle Nedward again, the cast singing a song about saving the mountain, Uncle Nedward climbing up the side of the mountain to retrieve Munchy, and more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Isaiah Crews Excels in His Breakout Role</h2><p>I think the correct terminology to explain Isaiah Crews as an actor is like father-like-son. Terry Crews will forever be known for his comedy role in the film White Chicks, so it’s no surprise that his son is following in his footsteps. Prior to Side Hustle, Crews’ had only appeared on his family reality shows, The Family Crews. This Nickelodeon role is truly his breakout role in acting and he’s totally excelling in it.</p><p>Side Hustle premiered on Nickelodeon in 2020 and is currently airing it’s second season. The show’s Instagram page has over 14,000 followers and has gained tons of traction on Instagram Reels. Even though this is Isaiah Crews’ acting debut, It’s clear people love him in this series. His character Munchy is a comedic character that lives next door to the two main girls. Without Munchy, there is no Side Hustle. Isaiah Crews previously <a href=#>shared</a> that his father’s role in White Chicks inspired his acting career, so it’s no surprise he’s excelling in this role.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NUP_196523_00243.jpg alt="Did You Know ‘AGT: Extreme’ Golden Buzzer Cyndel Flores Competed on ‘AGT’?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>agt</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>terry crews</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57056pq7FdmL%2Bmw9Jmnq6do6l6tMDAq6pmmZyku6i%2FyJ2cZqufo3qqv8CimKFlk6eyuL%2BMqKVmppmYuKa4zp2cqKajYsCqsMRmn66rpKGycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
