Redding was a renowned soul and rhythm and blues musician, otherwise known as “The King of Soul.” He released his debut album, “Pain In My Heart” in 1964 which produced his first No. 1 hit, “These Arms of Mine.” The song reached No. 20 on the R&B charts, and was included on several soundtracks, and most prominently in the 1987 film “Dirty Dancing. <a href=../../../../otis-redding-catalog-sony-music-publishing-14104.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../start-innovation.html>Welsh inventions | Wales.com</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

One man who certainly had a hand in getting the sport off the ground, however, is the Welsh inventor, Walter Clopton Wingfield.

This places him comfortably among America’s most unpopular senators ahead of a potential 2024 re-election run.
