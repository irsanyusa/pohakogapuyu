But where do the borders actually begin? As with so many historical terms, the definition isn’t precise.</p><p>YouGov RealTime asked the general public which counties should be included and 72% said Cornwall and Devon, 70% said Somerset and 69% said Bristol. People are less sure about Dorset, but a majority of 55% still consider it to be part of the West Country.</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/West20country20map-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=#>Click to enlarge</a></p><p>More expansive definitions of the West Country have included Wiltshire, Gloucester and Herefordshire, but the public don’t tend to agree.</p><p>Just 28% of people count Wiltshire as being in the West Country, as do only 27% for Gloucestershire. A mere 12% included Herefordshire, a scant margin higher than the 9% who include Worcestershire – a county that is resolutely not in the West Country and was only included as a basis for comparison.</p><p>Inhabitants of the South West of England, an area often seen as synonymous with the West Country, are more likely to hold a more inclusive definition of the term.</p><p>Aside from the fact that they are far more likely to include Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Bristol within the West Country’s borders (all between 82% and 89%), they are also more likely than Britons as a whole to include Dorset (63%), Wiltshire (44%) and Gloucestershire (39%).</p><p>In the case of Wiltshire, opinion among South Westerners is split between the 44% who say it is part of the West Country and the 42% who say it is not. Those 39% who include Gloucestershire, on the other hand, continue to be outvoted by the 50% who say it’s not part of the region.</p><p>When it comes to Herefordshire, South Westerners are less likely than the public as a whole to say the county falls within the borders of the West Country, at just 5%.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6aqa2hk6GytHuRbmxya12staqvx2aaqK2eqbamv4ymmKSdXayytMCMnKaupqSnxg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
