It’s absolutely incredible to think that one day my bar of soap will be able to make a direct impact on somebody else’s life. That’s the reason I started this all in the first place.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">--Read the cover story and watch the interview with 2024 Kid of the Year Heman Bekele. <a href=#>https://bit.ly/46N1413</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">--See the TIME cover, featuring a photograph by Dina Litovsky for TIME. <a href=#>https://bit.ly/4dfikOX</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>The other five 2024 Kid of the Year honorees include:</strong> inventor <strong>Shanya Gill</strong> (13, San Jose, CA), advocate <strong>Madhvi Chittoor</strong> (12, Arvada, CO), advocate <strong>Jordan Sucato</strong> (15, Phoenix, AZ), actor <strong>Keivonn Woodard</strong> (11, Bowie, MD), and entrepreneur <strong>Dom Pecora </strong>(15, Malvern, PA).

Typically, those we recognize are fully grown adults—in the prime of their careers or sage elders reflecting on long experience. But there are exceptions…. In fact, young people are some of the most impressive individuals out there…. That’s why we choose to recognize TIME’s Kid of the Year.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To select the 2024 Kid of the Year, TIME solicited nominations for young leaders who are making admirable contributions in a range of fields—including social justice, science, and business. Editors and writers combed through submissions and conducted research to identify stand-out kids in the U.S. ages 8-16. Then, as part of the selection process, a team of TIME for Kids Kid Reporters weighed in on the finalists. <a href=#>https://bit.ly/3WB0jDQ</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 2024 Kid of the Year package appears in the August 26 issue of TIME, available on newsstands on Friday, August 16.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">###</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>About TIME</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">TIME is the 101-year-old global media brand that reaches a combined audience of over 120 million around the world through its iconic magazine and digital platforms.
