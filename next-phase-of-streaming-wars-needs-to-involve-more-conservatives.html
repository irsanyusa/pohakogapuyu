But even then, it’s not only about age: While 39% of those who identified as liberal were Gen Z adults, a not-insignificant share of 17% identified as conservative.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Hollywood and most major media companies have long been viewed as catering to liberals more than conservatives, and as a result there’s an imbalance in media diets among the two groups. “People on the left like more pop culture than people on the right,” University of Toronto associate sociology professor Clayton Childress <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>said</a> recently.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This has translated to less media consumption overall among conservatives, which is reflected in our data. The shares of conservatives who reported using a video streaming service, listening to a podcast or streaming music in August were 9, 5 and 12 percentage points lower, respectively, than the equivalent shares of liberals. An outlier is traditional radio, with 80% of conservatives saying they listened to AM/FM radio at least once in August, compared with 74% of liberals who said the same, likely because radio is a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>more influential</a> news source for the former cohort.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But companies that are able to attract more conservatives can tap in to an audience of higher-earning consumers they aren’t already reaching. Nearly 1 in 3 (31%) of those who identify as conservative report earning at least $100,000 annually. While this is lower than the share of liberals (36%) saying the same, it’s still noteworthy considering media companies’ lower penetration into right-leaning households. Meanwhile, reaching more conservatives could help media companies reach more kids — via their parents — and better position themselves to build brand recognition with the next generation of consumers. Over a quarter (28%) of respondents who said they were homemakers in August identified as conservative, while just 22% said they were liberal.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Media companies can attract a bigger conservative audience through sports</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">To bridge the streaming gap, a few services such as Fox Nation and The Daily Wire+ have launched to appeal to conservatives, despite being relatively niche plays for now. Fox Nation has never publicly disclosed subscriber numbers, and Puck <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>recently reported</a> that The Daily Wire+ has 940,000 paying subscribers. While nearing 1 million subscribers is no small feat, it’s tiny in comparison to the 43 million global subscribers that Paramount+ — the most recent major video streamer to launch — counts globally. Meanwhile, video platform Rumble has grown its profile as a conservative alternative to YouTube, though its self-reported usage of <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>78 million</a> monthly users in August pales in comparison to that of the Google-owned platform, which says it has <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>over 2 billion</a> monthly logged-in users.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But the bigger opportunity to make inroads with conservative consumers —&nbsp;without necessitating a major pivot to news or political content — is sports. Like liberals and the general population, conservatives <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>are unsatisfied</a> with their access to sporting events, per Morning Consult data from June. Conservatives are also similarly dissatisfied with the news they get in their video subscription mixes, but sports is a better way for streamers to appeal to right-leaning audiences. Though sports is not necessarily apolitical, streamers generally run less of a risk of being seen as ideologically biased through sports content.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Our data shows that conservatives favor the NFL, MLB and college football most. The broadcast rights for these sports are <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>largely</a> <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>locked</a> <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>up</a> for years to come, with streamers like Peacock and Paramount+ standing to gain much from their parent companies’ aggressive promotion of their streaming rights to games from the Big 10 and the NFL.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But an underexplored area is conservative interest in motor sports: There’s a 7-point difference between conservatives who say they’re casual or avid fans of motor sports and liberals who say the same. Companies in particular should pay attention to NASCAR rights negotiations, given how prominent right-wing figures and themes have long <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>resonated</a> with NASCAR fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6OyucCMqZ%2Baq5VivKd50q2pnpmdnruoedaaqaxlnpqypb%2BMraZmoZ6rvK3CxGakqKqVYrCwutKeqa%2BZpJ7Dpr8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
