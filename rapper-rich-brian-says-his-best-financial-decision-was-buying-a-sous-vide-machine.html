I used to just wake up at 8 or 9 in the morning and think of things to post all day. Just because thats when Americans are asleep, Brian explains. And I would post them at night when [Americans] are starting to wake up. When Americans started watching Brians videos (which, he says, he wasnt paid for at the time), Brian changed to posting music videos (which, now, he is most definitely paid for.)</p><p>It was a pretty big moment when I realized I could buy video games, Brain says, when he first found himself flush with cash. I used to pirate video games a lot. I just realized that, oh, I have my own credit card now and I can just buy things. No more bootleg PlayStation games from his local store.</p><p>Still frugal (saving money actually gives me a rush), Brian stands by his best financial decision: purchasing a Sous Vide machine. Its a machine that cooks your food perfectly. Basically, you have a box of water and then whatever it is youre cooking, you put it in a plastic bag and vacuum seal it and put it in the water. They set the temperature for you. And you just leave it there for an hour, and it just cooks it perfectly every time. Weve never heard anyone so excited talking about kitchen purchases.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Worst purchase? A car? A piece of jewelry? Nope. Brian: I signed up for L.A. Fitness and then I just ended up going to 24-Hour Fitness for like six whole months. And I just never canceled the L.A. Fitness one. I just feel like an asshole for not canceling. But I didnt. I regret that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cL7Aqaeeql2ntqS0jJupopmeYsCixdJmn6KrXZeytMCMn6CnmZ6YtqK4jJ2cnKGjnryvedaaqmaapa62r7OMmmSsp6Woere1w55kppmTnbavsY5voXGkmpnG</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
