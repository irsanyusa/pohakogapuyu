I know that, and I apologize for that,” Sandoval said, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ET</a>. “I fully f**king regret it. I feel bad about it. I hate that I hurt people. I, for the most part, have been pretty f**king miserable. I don’t ever, ever want to go through what I went through again. I don’t ever want to be responsible or the cause for ever hurting people like that.”</p><p>When asked what he would do differently, Sandoval said he wouldn’t have had the affair with Leviss. He also shared his regret for not breaking up with Madix sooner.
