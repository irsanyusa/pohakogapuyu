I&nbsp;mean, not bad, but that doesn’t sound nearly as&nbsp;fun as&nbsp;those cool giant creatures you get to&nbsp;see in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>.</p><p>Yeah, you recognize the iconic roar here. It&nbsp;appeared on&nbsp;TV, in&nbsp;comic books, in&nbsp;video games, and in&nbsp;cinema. I&nbsp;mean, c’mon, it&nbsp;even got its own star on&nbsp;the Hollywood Walk of&nbsp;Fame on&nbsp;its 50th birthday [2004]. So... What would it&nbsp;take to&nbsp;get good old Godzilla from the&nbsp;TV screen to&nbsp;our streets?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4bf/b20/7a37eb54a1a0fc8f64bccc3efa.png><p>And we’re talking about the beast that’s really <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>gigantic</u></a>. In&nbsp;the original film from 1954, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Godzilla</u></a> was thought to&nbsp;be&nbsp;164 feet tall. This was the perfect height for the monster to&nbsp;just peer over the biggest buildings in&nbsp;Tokyo at&nbsp;the time. But as&nbsp;further movies came, Godzilla became bigger and bigger.</p><p>In&nbsp;theory, this would be&nbsp;the biggest <a href=# title=animal data-link=tag>animal</a> that could exist and not end up&nbsp;crushed by&nbsp;the gravitational field of&nbsp;our planet&nbsp;— even if&nbsp;we’re talking about some “tiny” Godzilla&nbsp;of, let’s say, 14,000&nbsp;tons. To&nbsp;take the gravitational force of&nbsp;our planet and carry such weight, Godzilla must have some incredibly strong bones. And as&nbsp;an&nbsp;object gets bigger, its volume will actually increase faster than its surface area.</p><p>Okay, wait, let’s start <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>small</u></a>. So, cells are the building blocks of&nbsp;life, and they come in&nbsp;all shapes and sizes. But the thing&nbsp;is, cells have a&nbsp;problem when they try to&nbsp;grow too big. As&nbsp;they grow, their surface area&nbsp;— the outside&nbsp;— doesn’t keep up&nbsp;with their volume&nbsp;— which means the inside. It’s like having a&nbsp;big mouth but a&nbsp;tiny stomach&nbsp;— you can’t digest all the food you want to&nbsp;eat. Why haven’t I&nbsp;learned that already, especially when&nbsp;I open my&nbsp;fridge for a&nbsp;midnight “snack”?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/876/6c2/0b9a7753339f60435ab920359f.png><p>So, if&nbsp;cells get too big, they can’t get enough nutrients in&nbsp;and waste out fast enough. It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;like living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very big house but with just one tiny door to&nbsp;go&nbsp;in&nbsp;and out. Plus, that’s not their only problem. Cells also need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;divide and replicate&nbsp;— and this task gets tricky as&nbsp;they get bigger. They need this thing called microtubules for that. It’s sort of&nbsp;like a&nbsp;skeleton that gives them structure.</p><p>But don’t worry, <a href=# title=evolution data-link=tag>evolution</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;foxy little thing. There are some cells out there, like a&nbsp;specific type of&nbsp;invasive algae [Caulerpa taxifolia], that have found ways to&nbsp;break the rules and get really big&nbsp;— and they don’t even need to&nbsp;divide to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that. This alga could pass as&nbsp;an&nbsp;aquatic fern that has fronds up&nbsp;to&nbsp;31&nbsp;inches long, but what you’re looking at&nbsp;is&nbsp;just one big cell.</p><p>It&nbsp;has multiple nuclei though, which are like the control centers of&nbsp;cells. Plus, there are even some <a href=# title=bacteria data-link=tag>bacteria</a> that are living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbiotic relationship with the organism, which means they help each other out when necessary. It’s like having a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;different rooms inside one big house&nbsp;— with some roommates living there that help around from time to&nbsp;time!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c97/640/5b18535688badd29ff7a668468.png><p>Then there’s a&nbsp;monster alga known as&nbsp;the sailor’s eyeball [Valonia ventricosa], which is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;giant ball of&nbsp;green slime. It&nbsp;can grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;2&nbsp;inches in&nbsp;diameter but is&nbsp;also considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;just a&nbsp;single cell.</p><p>My&nbsp;personal favorite would be&nbsp;this one [Acetabularia]. Again, we’re talking about a&nbsp;single cell. But check out its stem and cap&nbsp;— it&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;tiny little umbrella! It&nbsp;can grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;4&nbsp;inches tall, which is&nbsp;definitely not bad for a&nbsp;single cell! Most cells are too small to&nbsp;see with the naked eye, but these fellas don’t hesitate to&nbsp;break the rules.</p><p>Now, when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;animals getting really big, there’s a&nbsp;limit to&nbsp;their size. It’s like trying to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;really tall tower&nbsp;— eventually, it&nbsp;will become too heavy, and the base won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;support the weight anymore. Similarly, when an&nbsp;animal gets really big, its bones and muscles have to&nbsp;evolve to&nbsp;support all that weight, and it&nbsp;becomes more and more difficult to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the movies, Godzilla was 390 feet tall. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>At&nbsp;that size</u></a>, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;really difficult for its heart to&nbsp;pump blood to&nbsp;its brain.</p><p>And if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;reptile, Godzilla would need to&nbsp;spend all of&nbsp;its time lying in&nbsp;the sun to&nbsp;stay warm. So&nbsp;we’d have to&nbsp;hide in&nbsp;the shadows, hoping some bigger animals that live in&nbsp;warm areas could keep it&nbsp;full. If&nbsp;Godzilla was a&nbsp;mammal, though, it&nbsp;would generate too much body heat and end up&nbsp;cooking itself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9d3/f9e/20c2745eabaacb7561d6c2708a.png><p>The biggest land animals we&nbsp;know of&nbsp;were sauropods, a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;dinosaur with a&nbsp;really long neck and tail. They could grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;131 feet long and weigh up&nbsp;to&nbsp;70&nbsp;tonnes, which could be&nbsp;as&nbsp;heavy as&nbsp;10&nbsp;elephants! Evolution was pretty efficient when it&nbsp;had to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with its body plan. Sauropods ate plants. They had a&nbsp;smart way of&nbsp;eating that allowed them to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;one spot and still find enough food. They could move their long necks around to&nbsp;reach plants, so&nbsp;they didn’t have to&nbsp;walk around too much or&nbsp;waste too much energy. My&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;folks!</p><p>That’s impressive, but let’s get realistic&nbsp;— not many giant animals are happy to&nbsp;eat salad for dinner. If&nbsp;you had a&nbsp;giant beast such as&nbsp;Godzilla, you can expect it&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;after its prey. And that becomes too hard for its body to&nbsp;support all that weight and perform all the necessary activities.</p><p>The largest meat-eating dinosaurs were still pretty big, but not as&nbsp;big as&nbsp;the sauropods. The biggest one we&nbsp;know of&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fella called Spinosaurus, which was about 50&nbsp;feet long. It&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;survive by&nbsp;eating fish and some other creatures that lived in&nbsp;the water. It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;so&nbsp;cool to&nbsp;have Godzilla in&nbsp;real life&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you have some safe basement where it&nbsp;won’t find you, of&nbsp;course- but it’s not likely some animal could really get bigger than our beloved sauropod&nbsp;— at&nbsp;least not without running into some serious physical limitations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b6c/74b/5efe5457c3bf9b81eabf6db1e2.png><p>And have you ever wondered how big a&nbsp;plant could get? It&nbsp;turns out some trees have already reached amazing heights, such as&nbsp;the General Sherman, the largest living tree on&nbsp;the planet! It’s more than 275 feet tall and has nearly 53,000 cubic feet of&nbsp;wood! It’s gigantic, but still a&nbsp;little bit smaller than the Lindsey Creek French Tree, the biggest tree ever recorded. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;coast redwood 390 feet tall and had a&nbsp;volume of&nbsp;more than 90,000 cubic feet&nbsp;— which is&nbsp;as&nbsp;big as&nbsp;some skyscrapers!</p><p>But it&nbsp;ain’t easy for plants to&nbsp;get big either. When they’re tall, it’s tricky for them to&nbsp;get water from the roots to&nbsp;the leaves. Redwoods have a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;tricks up&nbsp;their sleeves though. For example, they absorb moisture from fog through their leaves. Plus, they have a&nbsp;wide base that gives them more support. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;build taller buildings, we&nbsp;also need to&nbsp;think about the challenges plants face&nbsp;— like how to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;good base that will support the structure and transport water and nutrients.</p><p>If&nbsp;we’re not just looking for height, we&nbsp;can take a&nbsp;peek at&nbsp;other massive organisms on&nbsp;our home planet, such as&nbsp;Pando. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;male aspen forest in&nbsp;Utah that covers 107 acres and is&nbsp;basically one giant organism! It&nbsp;weighs almost 6,000 tonnes and is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the biggest organisms on&nbsp;Earth! Perfect salad bowl for Godzilla.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1a3/6fb/3cecee5e2087a15b0ff52b0d70.png><p>I&nbsp;mean, plants aren’t the only organisms that can grow to&nbsp;massive sizes. There are fungi, like the honey mushroom, that can grow into a&nbsp;network of&nbsp;tiny threads called hyphae. They tend to&nbsp;spread out over big areas. And it’s like a&nbsp;pretty big underground web connecting everything together.</p><p>One specimen in&nbsp;Michigan covers 90&nbsp;acres and weighs about 400&nbsp;tonnes. Now, that’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;mushrooms!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6zsYygpp2ymaG5onnSorGenF2Wu6q5wKWqZqifqMCqrsueZHFpZmV%2BeXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
