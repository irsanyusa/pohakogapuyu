It’s an&nbsp;apex predator, and you can find it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the tropical regions of&nbsp;Central and South America. In&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;their lifting capabilities, they’ve been recorded to&nbsp;tackle up&nbsp;to&nbsp;40&nbsp;lbs!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/738/748/a4ba2e580b88d2e65ff492a1e1.png><p>The females of&nbsp;the species are bigger and stronger and can sometimes lift even more than that! Why do&nbsp;they need to&nbsp;lift that much, you might ask. Well, because on&nbsp;their menus&nbsp;— they often hunt mammals that are larger than they are, like sloths or&nbsp;even monkeys.</p><p>The birds’ strength mostly comes from their sharp claws, which are similar in&nbsp;size to&nbsp;the human hand. Not only are these claws good at&nbsp;carrying things, but they also help the birds crush objects, like the <a href=# title=bones data-link=tag>bones</a> of&nbsp;their prey.</p><p><strong>Owls</strong> are equally as&nbsp;strong, and the <strong>great horned</strong> one is&nbsp;among the toughest birds out there. The primary residence of&nbsp;this species is&nbsp;in&nbsp;North and South America. As&nbsp;for their eating preferences, you’ll often find them hunting for small mammals, like rabbits or&nbsp;other rodents.</p><p>On&nbsp;average, an&nbsp;adult male of&nbsp;this species can weigh up&nbsp;to&nbsp;5.5&nbsp;lbs<strong>.</strong> But it&nbsp;can lift up&nbsp;to&nbsp;four times its body weight! That’s because of&nbsp;their awesome wingspan&nbsp;— about 5&nbsp;feet&nbsp;— and sharp claws that stretch for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;inches in&nbsp;length.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/92d/9cf/81baec5188b027fe30d4ead4d5.png><p>The biggest type of&nbsp;falcon on&nbsp;Earth is&nbsp;the gyrfalcon. It&nbsp;may weigh somewhere around 3&nbsp;lbs, but it&nbsp;can lift up&nbsp;to&nbsp;5&nbsp;lbs! It’s similar to&nbsp;you trying to&nbsp;fly while carrying a&nbsp;panda bear!</p><p>They also have a&nbsp;wingspan of&nbsp;about 6.6&nbsp;feet, paired with razor-sharp claws that can go&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;3.1 inches in&nbsp;length. No&nbsp;wonder the gyrfalcon is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most feared predators in&nbsp;the Arctic region. They mostly feed on&nbsp;birds, such as&nbsp;ptarmigans, waterfowls, pheasants, and even other falcons.</p><p>The <strong>Bald Eagle</strong> is&nbsp;the national emblem of&nbsp;the United States, so&nbsp;you can safely assume it’s a&nbsp;powerful and independent bird. It&nbsp;can weigh anywhere between 6.6 and 13.9&nbsp;pounds. It&nbsp;stands pretty tall, too, at&nbsp;28–40&nbsp;inches. The greatest weight a&nbsp;bald eagle has been recorded to&nbsp;carry is&nbsp;15&nbsp;pounds!</p><p>Interestingly, their diet mostly consists of&nbsp;<a href=# title=fish data-link=tag>fish</a>. The reason why the bald eagle can carry so&nbsp;much weight is&nbsp;because of&nbsp;its large wingspan, which can be&nbsp;from 71&nbsp;to&nbsp;90&nbsp;inches<strong>.</strong> Apart from that, it&nbsp;has an&nbsp;impressive diving speed, too: up&nbsp;to&nbsp;99&nbsp;mph<strong>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/968/de4/c2b26f5a9bb4d1215d00a87b54.png><p>One of&nbsp;the largest birds of&nbsp;prey in&nbsp;North and South America is&nbsp;called the <strong>red-tailed hawk</strong>. Looking at&nbsp;its measurements, you’ll see it&nbsp;can weigh roughly 3.5&nbsp;lbs. Their wings stretch for 4.5&nbsp;feet, and their strong claws can reach 3&nbsp;inches in&nbsp;length. Similar to&nbsp;the gyrfalcon, these powerful birds can carry almost double their weight. You’ll find them hunting for squirrels and rabbits, for the most part, but they do&nbsp;enjoy small birds, too, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;fish and reptiles.</p><p>Taking the gold medal for heavy weightlifting on&nbsp;our planet is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;bird but an&nbsp;insect: the bumblebee. They can lift up&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>80</strong>&nbsp;percent of&nbsp;their body weight when they are in&nbsp;the air. That would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot, even if&nbsp;they were simply crawling!</p><p>Not only are they strong, but they seem to&nbsp;have great knowledge, too. To&nbsp;reach as&nbsp;many <a href=# title=flowers data-link=tag>flowers</a> as&nbsp;they do&nbsp;to&nbsp;gather pollen, they use complex mathematics that can be&nbsp;difficult even for a&nbsp;computer. That’s because these amazing insects take into consideration all the elements and parameters to&nbsp;ensure their results are very precise.</p><p>Bumblebees look at&nbsp;the distance they need to&nbsp;travel, estimate how much <a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a> they have left, and even use the direction of&nbsp;the wind to&nbsp;boost their speed. They’re also able to&nbsp;check which flowers have the best quality pollen before heading for them. If&nbsp;that’s not astonishing enough, they don’t even stop to&nbsp;make all these measurements: they do&nbsp;it&nbsp;while flying!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/487/053/06c375542097bcd3b75f604781.png><p>Mosquitos are just as&nbsp;impressive when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;their flying skills. Not because of&nbsp;how much they can lift, although that’s also quite impressive: the belly of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mosquito can carry three times its own weight! But it’s also their unique flying style that makes them special&nbsp;— and hard to&nbsp;study!</p><p>For starters, they spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time in&nbsp;the air. It’s where they find mates, hunt, and even lay eggs. Because of&nbsp;how hard it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;study the flight of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;small insect, for a&nbsp;long period of&nbsp;time, we&nbsp;simply assumed that mosquitos were not that good at&nbsp;flying. But in&nbsp;2017, a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;researchers eventually figured out how mosquitos stayed in&nbsp;the air. The scientists used eight cameras for the experiment, and each of&nbsp;them captured 10,000 frames per second.</p><p>Bees or&nbsp;flies, for example, catch wind under their large wing flaps and use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;boost their speed. Unlike them, mosquitoes use a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;movements: they have short wing flaps that they pair with a&nbsp;spinning motion. This unique flying pattern allows them to&nbsp;create pockets of&nbsp;air, which both launches them forward and keeps them afloat.</p><p>Try to&nbsp;imagine sticking your hand out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;car window while driving. Each time you change the angle of&nbsp;your hand, you can feel it&nbsp;being lifted. All because of&nbsp;that small pocket of&nbsp;air that is&nbsp;trapped in&nbsp;your palm. That’s exactly what mosquitos&nbsp;do, and it&nbsp;allows them to&nbsp;move in&nbsp;whatever direction they want with enough boost.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/261/1b9/5995255f4694619e18b59b43af.png><p>So, we’ve established that all sorts of&nbsp;flying creatures on&nbsp;our planet can carry a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;weight. But would it&nbsp;be&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;actually get lifted up&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;insects? The answer is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit complex, but let’s look at&nbsp;the data. Your average housefly can lift somewhere around 10&nbsp;milligrams, which is&nbsp;roughly 22&nbsp;millionths of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pound. That’s <strong>50%</strong> of&nbsp;its own body weight.</p><p>You try to&nbsp;carry 55&nbsp;pounds and fly at&nbsp;the same time! If&nbsp;we&nbsp;divide 110 pounds by&nbsp;how much a&nbsp;housefly can carry, the answer seems simple: you’ll need five million houseflies to&nbsp;lift you off the ground! Hold on&nbsp;a&nbsp;minute; just because we’ve figured out how many houseflies we&nbsp;need doesn’t mean we’re done here.</p><p>Firstly, imagine how much time you’d need to&nbsp;gather 5&nbsp;million of&nbsp;these insects. Then there’s another pressing issue: the surface area. For each of&nbsp;these insects to&nbsp;be&nbsp;lifting the assigned weight, they’d need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;touching you.</p><p>On&nbsp;average, an&nbsp;adult human has a&nbsp;surface area of&nbsp;about 17.2 square feet. Each housefly needs roughly a&nbsp;quarter square inch of&nbsp;gripping surface. I’ll spare you the math, but it&nbsp;means you can only have <strong>39,680</strong> flies sitting on&nbsp;you at&nbsp;any given time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/389/fe8/37ddcf5abc8c1fbb4796685eea.png><p>Flies sitting on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;other flies? That won’t work either since some of&nbsp;them won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;use their wings. You might consider attaching each fly to&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong filament, which will then be&nbsp;attached to&nbsp;you. You’d need a&nbsp;really strong material to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that but delicate enough to&nbsp;be&nbsp;attached to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fly.</p><p>They are not nearly as&nbsp;strong as&nbsp;bumblebees, but butterflies do&nbsp;deserve a&nbsp;place on&nbsp;the honorable mentions list. Sure, they don’t lift and carry things. But they do&nbsp;need their strength to&nbsp;avoid predators and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;fly. And, most important of&nbsp;them all, they need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;powerful enough to&nbsp;come out of&nbsp;their cocoons so&nbsp;that they can develop properly.</p><p>Once the cocoon cracks open, they have to&nbsp;find their way out. Most of&nbsp;them need to&nbsp;flip to&nbsp;get into the best position. Then they need to&nbsp;climb out of&nbsp;their shell. All within minutes, sometimes even seconds. Moths are equally as&nbsp;delicate and fascinating.</p><p>They can’t carry a&nbsp;lot either, but some studies have shown they can transport their reproductive partner away from danger when needed. Not only is&nbsp;that really nice of&nbsp;them, but it’s also a&nbsp;sign that moths can carry their own weight mid-flight. However, the distance they travel has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;really short because they lose energy really fast.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4yhnJquqWK8p3nAZq6eoZedwW6vwKdkm6GimcBuuMifq2ZwYWqDdn%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
