No&nbsp;one knew what kind of&nbsp;symbols those were and who left them. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the local news reported this, people immediately began to&nbsp;make their guesses. The most popular version was a&nbsp;message from a&nbsp;civilization living on&nbsp;another planet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dd1/3b0/2cde8a50258641e14240731ac3.png><p>The first crop circles appeared in&nbsp;the 70s in&nbsp;many areas across the U.S. and England. Some compared these symbols to&nbsp;the writings of&nbsp;the ancient Maya. Others thought those were messages about the approaching apocalypse. But few doubted that their authors were from another civilization. But that geometric pattern in&nbsp;Chiseldon was different from all the others because of&nbsp;an&nbsp;event that happened 8&nbsp;years later.</p><p>In&nbsp;2004, a&nbsp;man from New Mexico found a&nbsp;strange stone 11&nbsp;miles from Roswell. The rock had the same pattern on&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;the crop circle in&nbsp;Chiseldon. It’s worth noting that Roswell became a&nbsp;famous place after&nbsp;— according to&nbsp;rumors and legends&nbsp;— a&nbsp;spaceship from another planet crashed there. Therefore, when the farmer found the stone and posted its photo on&nbsp;the Internet, many people thought it&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;that spaceship.</p><p>The stone was perfectly smooth, and the pattern was applied with incredible precision. But the most remarkable thing was its magnetic properties. It&nbsp;rotated counterclockwise when people put the magnet next to&nbsp;its northern part. When they left the magnet near the southern side, the stone turned in&nbsp;the other direction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/43b/bfb/0dc23c580cac718e493f6ff957.png><p>Computed tomography and X-rays showed that there hadn’t been any elements inside the stone that could cause rotation. It&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;smooth piece of&nbsp;rock. But was the Roswell Rock really part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;spaceship? To&nbsp;answer this question, we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;England&nbsp;— the year 1976.</p><p>An&nbsp;<a href=# title=artist data-link=tag>artist</a> named Doug Bower met his friend Dave Chorley and invited him to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;impressive performance. At&nbsp;that time, people only learned about strange patterns in&nbsp;the fields from some books and records. And, of&nbsp;course, none of&nbsp;these cases had been confirmed. The two friends understood that all this was nothing more than myths. Therefore, they decided to&nbsp;draw a&nbsp;big pattern in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wheat field in&nbsp;Wiltshire.</p><p>They didn’t expect this drawing to&nbsp;become so&nbsp;popular. Many newspapers began to&nbsp;write about mysterious circles. Hundreds of&nbsp;reporters filmed it&nbsp;on&nbsp;cameras, and people watching&nbsp;TV were shocked. From that moment&nbsp;on, crop circles became a&nbsp;cultural phenomenon. People mixed facts with fiction and created more and more unbelievable legends. Someone said that they had seen mysterious lights in&nbsp;the sky above the circles.</p><p>In&nbsp;any case, those two friends continued to&nbsp;draw patterns and revealed their secret only in&nbsp;2009. They also created the mysterious drawing in&nbsp;Chiseldon. But that Roswell Rock wasn’t their job. Anyway, they said that the stone was also a&nbsp;fake. Other artists could draw the same pattern on&nbsp;the rock using stone-cutting equipment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/21b/de1/4d51cf561ea2a2a14478d68873.png><p>One of&nbsp;the most mysterious books in&nbsp;the world is&nbsp;the Voynich manuscript. Nobody knows who its author was, but they wrote it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the 15th century. No&nbsp;one can understand the contents of&nbsp;this manuscript, consisting of&nbsp;240&nbsp;pages, for more than 500&nbsp;years. Just imagine, all the words were written by&nbsp;hand in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown language. Almost every page is&nbsp;decorated with strange images of&nbsp;female figures and weird unknown <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a>.</p><p>The book was first discovered in&nbsp;1912 and immediately became a&nbsp;cultural phenomenon. Many scientists, polyglots, and historians have tried to&nbsp;decipher the language and understand its meaning. They put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Internet, so&nbsp;everyone could try to&nbsp;solve the mystery. And it&nbsp;seems that Nicholas Gibbs, a&nbsp;historian and writer, managed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this. He&nbsp;spent many years studying medieval Latin language and literature.</p><p>Gibbs noticed the manuscript contained Latin abbreviations often used in&nbsp;Medieval medical treatises and reference books. Gibbs even found out that the book was a&nbsp;plagiarism of&nbsp;other, older medical reference works. He&nbsp;compared the Voynich manuscript with other Latin books and saw many similar words. Gibbs claimed that the manuscript was dedicated to&nbsp;women’s health. And the mysterious flowers were real <a href=# title=herbs data-link=tag>herbs</a> and plants. But it&nbsp;wasn’t that simple.</p><p>Nicholas Gibbs was one of&nbsp;many who put forward the theory. Many scientists recognized his version as&nbsp;banal and unconvincing. Other decoders claimed that some secret code was used in&nbsp;the manuscript. Some were sure that it&nbsp;was written by&nbsp;Dominican nuns. Others described it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reference book on&nbsp;astrology and herbs. Anyway, you can find scans of&nbsp;the manuscript in&nbsp;high resolution on&nbsp;the Internet and try to&nbsp;crack the code.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d99/63a/6bb6a95de89831bd62a183eafa.png><p>Imagine that you’re walking around <a href=# title="New York" data-link=tag>New York</a> and entering a&nbsp;dark, deserted alley. Then, you see some canvas with a&nbsp;beautiful picture on&nbsp;it&nbsp;lying in&nbsp;a&nbsp;trash can. You don’t really understand what exactly is&nbsp;depicted there. But you still feel some power of&nbsp;art emanating from&nbsp;it. You take the painting home and hang it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the wall.</p><p>It’s been hanging there for almost 4&nbsp;years. Then, you publish a&nbsp;photo with the painting on&nbsp;the website with antiques and discover that this picture is&nbsp;a&nbsp;missing masterpiece worth $1&nbsp;million! This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real story that happened to&nbsp;a&nbsp;New Yorker in&nbsp;2003. Famous Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo painted this picture, called “Three People,” in&nbsp;1970.</p><p>One collector bought it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift for his wife. But in&nbsp;1989, someone stole the work while they were moving to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new house. It&nbsp;was possible that the thief didn’t appreciate this piece of&nbsp;art or&nbsp;couldn’t find a&nbsp;buyer, so&nbsp;they threw it&nbsp;into the nearest trash can. The woman who found it&nbsp;returned the work to&nbsp;the owner and received a&nbsp;$15,000&nbsp;reward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c5b/8e3/9aab685600ab97257a98fdf773.png><p>Expensive paintings often end up&nbsp;in&nbsp;garbage cans. Van Gogh gave his works to&nbsp;various people, but they didn’t take them seriously at&nbsp;that time. When these paintings were found many years later, they were estimated at&nbsp;dozens of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;dollars. For example, the artist gave his doctor his portrait. The doctor was horrified by&nbsp;the painting.</p><p>Perhaps he&nbsp;didn’t like the red shade of&nbsp;the hair. He&nbsp;gave the portrait to&nbsp;his mother, and she found a&nbsp;use for&nbsp;it. She covered the hole in&nbsp;her chicken coop with the picture. For more than 10&nbsp;years, chickens had been running under the work of&nbsp;art. Then, another artist found the painting. He&nbsp;paid the doctor pennies for&nbsp;it. Now it’s estimated at&nbsp;$50&nbsp;million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9d5/07d/db37a85649b6a4470ed653aa22.png><p>A&nbsp;similar case with a&nbsp;discarded work of&nbsp;art occurred in&nbsp;Italy. One gardener worked at&nbsp;the Ricci Oddi Gallery of&nbsp;Modern Art. He&nbsp;was removing ivy from the building’s walls and found a&nbsp;rusty metal door in&nbsp;the thicket. He&nbsp;opened it&nbsp;and got into a&nbsp;dark room. There was a&nbsp;garbage bag lying there.</p><p>The gardener wanted to&nbsp;throw it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the trash but decided to&nbsp;look inside first. And he&nbsp;found the lost work of&nbsp;famous artist Gustav Klimt. During the renovation of&nbsp;the gallery in&nbsp;1997, someone stole the painting “Portrait of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Lady.” It&nbsp;turned out that the thief had never taken it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;the building. Its value is&nbsp;estimated at&nbsp;$66&nbsp;million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f56/ef0/ec998d5cc499f6f94f4009227c.png><p>In&nbsp;1901, collectors of&nbsp;sea sponges discovered a&nbsp;mysterious chest in&nbsp;the sea waters near Greece. There was a&nbsp;strange object inside, similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;mechanical watch and the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;shoebox. The finding attracted the attention of&nbsp;archaeologists. They quickly established that this item was created in&nbsp;Ancient Greece about 2,200 years ago.</p><p>They called it&nbsp;the Antikythera [anti-khe-FI-ra] mechanism. Now it’s in&nbsp;the National Archaeological Museum in&nbsp;Athens. Scientists have found out that this object is&nbsp;only 82&nbsp;fragments&nbsp;— one-third of&nbsp;the original mechanism. It’s still unknown who created it&nbsp;and how it&nbsp;works. But experts think it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;mechanical computer with bronze gears and other parts.</p><p>People used it&nbsp;for astronomical calculations. The device could track the movements of&nbsp;the Sun, the Moon, and five planets of&nbsp;the Solar System. Experts are still trying to&nbsp;figure out all the properties of&nbsp;this machine. It’s considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the oldest computer on&nbsp;Earth. It&nbsp;proves that the level of&nbsp;technology two thousand years ago was much higher than we&nbsp;could imagine.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLa0edOhoKxlna7AtbHRoqauq12nvKS3jJqara2Robm6ecWrpqZlo6WupLGMcWhubmVmfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
