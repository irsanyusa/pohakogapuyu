From print quality to price to shipping to the overall ordering process, there’s a lot to consider when choosing a photo printing service. So I asked professional photographers for advice on how to choose the right service, and included my picks for the best photo printing services to help you get started.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-using-photo-printing-services>What to consider when using photo printing services</h2><p>I asked professional photographers how they choose the best photo printing services to balance photo quality and cost. Here’s what they recommend</p><h3>Type of printing</h3><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Kari Bjorn</a>, a wedding photographer in Fayetteville, Arkansas, has been shooting since 2010. In addition to doing in-studio inkjet prints, Bjorn has used a few printing services. “There are many ways to print a photo,” advises Bjorn. “Most of the affordable options and chains use dye sublimation printing. It’s fast, colorful, and reasonably durable.”</p><p>He explains that inkjet printing is a mid-range option. There are typically four paper choices with inkjet printing, though more specialized papers are also available. Most commonly, you’ll find luster, glossy, matte, and semi-matte papers offered.</p><h3>Type of paper</h3><p>Consider the overall appearance you want your photo to have. Bjorn explains that different paper types have different advantages and disadvantages. “Lustre, sometimes called pearl after the little bubbles on the surface of the paper, produces colorful and contrasting prints,” he says. “Glossy papers are best for smaller prints, as they reflect a lot of light and are therefore not great for wall prints.”</p><p>Matte papers tend to soak up more ink than other types of paper, so images usually have a flatter, less saturated look than what will appear on a computer screen. “This will need to be adjusted before printing,” says Bjorn. “Semi-matte papers offer slightly more sheen and colors than matte.”</p><p>Bjorn recommends you always choose archival and acid-free papers, since they last the longest. “Regular papers aren’t acidic; they just tilt slightly on the acidic side, and that acid can react to your natural body oil that’s on your fingers when you handle the prints.” It’s also possible to choose pigments and inks that are more archival. “When combined, these archival products can make prints that can last hundreds of years,” he explains.</p><h3>Reputation</h3><p>Alex Perelmuter, photographer and videographer at <a rel=nofollow href=#>New Jersey Videography</a>, notes a company’s reputation and reviews can provide important insight into its operations. “Look for feedback from previous customers regarding the quality of prints, customer service, delivery times, and overall experience,” he recommends.</p><h3>Pricing structure</h3><p>While it might be tempting to choose a service that offers the lowest prices, it’s important to look for a balance of price and overall quality. “Compare the pricing structures of different photo printing services to ensure you’re getting the best value for your money,” Perelmuter recommends. “Keep in mind that the cheapest option may not always provide the desired quality.”</p><p>“I always notice a tension between price, quality, and durability when discussing printing options with my clients,” says Bjorn. “Chain stores, for example, are mostly going to offer quick and affordable services that are not going to be high quality or durable. If you want 10 4x6s made from pictures on your phone, then that might be the best option. Photographers who offer in-house prints and professional labs are more expensive but their products will usually be of high quality and made with durable materials.”</p><h3>Ease of use</h3><p>Consider how easy it is to order prints, too. Many printing services offer their own photo upload platforms, some of which include basic editing capabilities. As you narrow down your choices, try each service’s platform and see how well you can navigate it.</p><h3>Speed and shipping options</h3><p>Depending on how you plan to use the photos, the speed and shipping options a photo printing service offers may be important. Some services print and ship photos in as little as a day. Services offering more professional printing may take longer, but you may be able to speed up the process by purchasing expedited shipping.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-photo-printing-services>Our top picks for the best photo printing services</h2><h3>Easiest-to-use photo printing service: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mpix</a></h3><p>Mpix features an easy-to-use interface, the ability to store photos and a comprehensive suite of products.

He recommends you follow general pointers, like moving the subject into a well-lit area. “A well-lit photograph will always print better than a dark one, so make sure you’re getting it right in camera,” he says. Post-processing software like Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom can help you to further adjust your photos.</p><p>“Before sending your photos for printing, <a rel=nofollow href=#>calibrate your computer monitor</a> to ensure the colors and brightness you see on screen accurately represent how they will appear in print,” Perelmuter recommends. He notes that it’s also important to consider the type of paper that you’re printing on. “If your photos will be printed with borders or mounted on a canvas, account for any necessary cropping or bleeding in your image composition,” he says.</p><p>Bjorn notes that if you plan to print photos from your phone, it's particularly important to make sure you’re providing them in the right resolution. “Phone photos are often in 72 or 144 <a rel=nofollow href=#>dpi (dots per inch) resolution</a>, where printers need a resolution of 300 dpi to print well,” he says. “This is why you often see bad results from chains, as no conversion happens and they just print what comes. So as [a photo printing service] if you need to do anything before sending your files.”</p><h2 id=printing-services-to-avoid>Printing services to avoid</h2><p>Like choosing the <a rel=alternate href=#>best places to order custom t-shirts online</a>, research is key.
