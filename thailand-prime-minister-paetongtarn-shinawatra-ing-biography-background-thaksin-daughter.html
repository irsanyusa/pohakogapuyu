Former premier <a href=#>Thaksin Shinawatra</a>, her billionaire father who was in the post from 2001 to 2006 before being pushed out in a military coup, returned to Thailand from 15 years of self-imposed exile last year and is expected now to play a bigger role in Thai politics.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some of her top tasks will be to ease the concerns of voters about the high costs of living and foreign investors worried about Thailand’s turbulent politics.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Why Thailand’s Political Crisis Feels Familiar—and What’s Needed to Break the Cycle</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what you need to know about her.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Who is Paetongtarn?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Known by her nickname Ing, she is the youngest daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, the patriarch of the political dynasty that has dominated most Thai elections since the turn of the century.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Paetongtarn studied political science at Thailand’s prestigious Chulalongkorn University and later received a master’s degree in international hotel management from University of Surrey in the U.K. At 17, she made headlines when she worked a part-time job at McDonald’s and her father dropped in.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She is married to Pidok Sooksawas, a commercial pilot. The couple have two children, including a baby boy that Paetongtarn gave birth to when she was on the campaign trail for last year’s election.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Thailand, Pregnancy, and Power</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What did she do before politics?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Most of Paetongtarn’s professional experience from 2011 until entering politics has been with the Shinawatra family’s business empire, which spans a golf course and firms in the real estate, hospitality, and telecommunications sectors.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She was until earlier this year listed as chief executive officer of the hotel business of Rende Development Co., which is run by her sister, Pintongta Shinawatra Kunakornwong and cites the luxurious Rosewood Hotel in Bangkok as a major project.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Currently she is the largest shareholder of publicly traded property firm SC Asset Corp. Pcl, with a 28.5% stake worth about 5.2 billion baht ($152 million), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Before taking the post of Prime Minister, Paetongtarn will need to relinquish her business roles and comply with share ownership rules, according to Thai laws.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How did she become a player in politics?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Paetongtarn had a front-row seat to Thaksin’s career. At eight, she tagged along with her father on his first government job as foreign minister. At 20, she hunkered down in a safe house when military tanks patrolled Bangkok streets as the army seized power from him. Two years later, she watched as her father left Thailand to avoid a corruption conviction he said was politically motivated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/paetongtarn-thaksin-thailand-daughter-prime-minister.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Paetongtarn formally started her political career when she joined Pheu Thai in 2021 as a director of the party’s innovation and inclusiveness committee. Two years later, she fronted Pheu Thai’s pre-election campaign and ran as one of its three prime ministerial candidates, pledging to end nearly a decade-long rule by the military-aligned administrations helmed by <a href=#>Prayuth Chan-ocha</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She had vowed to end a cycle of coups against her family—Thaksin was ousted in 2006 and her aunt Yingluck’s government toppled in 2014—as the Shinawatras were seen as a threat for more than a decade by royalist elites who control some of the nation’s most powerful institutions and businesses.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ironically, now she is reliant on the pro-royalist conservatives with which Pheu Thai <a href=#>formed a government</a>. Thaksin cut a deal last year to return to Thailand after more than a decade in exile while facing corruption charges.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What will be her administration’s key policies?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Paetongtarn’s victory helped Pheu Thai secure its leadership of the new government, this signals few changes to policies pursued by <a href=#>Srettha’s administration</a>. Her government is likely to focus on bolstering growth through looser fiscal policies as well as tackling the high cost of living and near-record household debt. She’s advocated for lower interest rates and slammed the central bank, saying its autonomy posed an “obstacle” to resolving the country’s economic issues.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What remains to be seen, however, is whether the change in leadership would provide a convenient pretext for her government to abandon a $14 billion digital wallet cash handout program. It was a flagship campaign promise of the Thaksin-backed Pheu Thai party and the centerpiece of <a href=#>Srettha’s push</a> to help the economy grow annually at 5% like many of its Southeast Asian neighbors.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When asked about it by reporters on the eve of her nomination, Paetongtarn only said she would review the program after she took power.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGFmg3d%2Bjq2fmqGclrulec%2BroKadXaK2r7XSrZyrZaCWsrW7zaCrmqqeYsCptc2arpqsopZ6qrrGZpmip5enrrG02GaZmpubnL%2Bwwc2dZK2gkaDAqrqMnZiun5ipsrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
