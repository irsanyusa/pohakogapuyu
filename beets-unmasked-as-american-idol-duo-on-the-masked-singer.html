The Beets were revealed to be American Idol stars Ruben Studdard and Clay Aiken. Meanwhile, Seal was unmasked as former child star Corey Feldman.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beets-unmasked-in-the-masked-singer-group-b-finals>Beets Unmasked in The Masked Singer Group B Finals</h2><p>Wednesday’s show marked the Group B Finals, which decided who should move on to the Quarterfinals. The episode featured a double unmasking. That included the reveal of two iconic American Idol stars under the Beets costumes.</p><p>For this week’s performance, the Beets joined forces on “One Moment in Time” by Whitney Houston. They ended up competing in a Battle Royale against Gumball, performing “(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life” from Dirty Dancing.</p><p>Ultimately, Gumball was chosen to move on, while the Beets had to be unmasked. Final guesses from the panel about their identity included K-Ci and JoJo, Dan + Shay, and CeeLo Green and Danger Mouse. None of them correctly guessed that they were American Idol stars Ruben Studdard and Clay Aiken.</p><p>Studdard and Aiken were the winner and runner-up of Season 2, and they’ve remained friends over 20 years later, even performing together on Broadway.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MISS CLEOCATRA UNMASKED ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ GIRL GROUP NIGHT</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-seal-unmasked-as-corey-feldman>Seal Unmasked as Corey Feldman</h2><p>The first contestant to be unmasked during Wednesday’s show was Seal, who entered the competition as a wildcard in last week’s show. He performed “It’s Tricky” by Run-D.M.C. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to send him to the next round.</p><p>Final guesses from the panel about his identity included Jerry O’Connell and Haley Joel Osment. However, only Jenny McCarthy and Robin Thicke were correct in guessing that it was Corey Feldman, famous for his roles in movies such as The Goonies and Stand By Me.</p><p>That means that Gumball is moving on to the Quarterfinals, where they’ll go up against Clock, Poodle Moth, and Goldfish for a chance to stay in the competition. During this week’s show, Gumball performed “Carry On Wayward Son” by Kansas.</p><p>Do you agree with this week’s results?
