Due to these remakes, different parts of the world found out about masterpieces in the film industry that had been unknown for years. But sometimes it turns out that creating a great film isn't always the best idea.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;tell you about some famous films that have wonderful original versions (despite their disappointing remakes) that you definitely have to&nbsp;watch.</p><p><h2>Anthony Zimmer, 2005&nbsp;/ The Tourist, 2010</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03e/14c/3b3c7e5c4f8ea54eabe749f4e1.jpg><p>The original version of the film was shot in France and Sophie Marceau played the main part. It received lots of good reviews from both ordinary viewers and critics. Nevertheless, its IMDb rating is only 6.5/10.</p><p>A remake failed at the box office despite its great cast (Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp) and advertising. The IMDb rating is 6/10. If you love stunning movies, we'd recommend you watch the French version.</p><p><h2>The Experiment, 2001&nbsp;/ The Experiment, 2010</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42c/c74/d7d8685da49811d9650da0e0b9.jpg><p>The original German version was released in&nbsp;2001 and became a&nbsp;classic. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;rating of&nbsp;7.7/10&nbsp;on IMDb. It&nbsp;tells the story of&nbsp;the famous Stanford prison experiment where a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;volunteers were randomly assigned to&nbsp;be&nbsp;either “guards” or&nbsp;“prisoners.”</p><p>The remake wasn’t that successful (it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;rating of&nbsp;6.4/10&nbsp;on IMDb). People didn’t like it&nbsp;even though the actors were really good in&nbsp;it. The most common complaints were the film’s implausibility, illogical actions, and plain characters that didn’t invoke any sympathy in&nbsp;viewers.</p><p><h2>Solyaris, 1972&nbsp;/ Solaris, 2002</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59e/7af/ee3eed55cdbabbf0b3075ea76e.jpg><p>Solyaris, made by the famous Tarkovsky, was released in 1972. The film is based on a novel of the same name and though the author of the book didn't like the movie, it won the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival and got an 8.1/10 rating.</p><p>The new version shot in 2002, strayed far from the original story. The author of the book didn't like it either since the love story was the main theme. The rating of this film was 6.2/10.</p><p>Those who have seen the original film and read the book didn't understand this attempt to reinterpret the plot. But the film is worth watching if you've never seen it before. We also recommend that you read the book.</p><p><h2>The Toy, 1976&nbsp;/ The Toy, 1982</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0bb/f01/1dfc385c348f39e0ec5079b7cf.jpg><p>Everyone's probably seen this French film starring Pierre Richard. It's about a boy whose wealthy parents decide to give him a new "toy" - a human. We can see that the relationship between the boy and the "toy" turns into a friendship and changes the child. The IMDb rating for this film is 7.5/10.</p><p>The film was reshot in 1982 and turned from drama to pure comedy. The boy with a new "toy" was no longer a child suffering from a lack of his parents' attention, but rather, a cruel and spoiled egoist. So we can't believe his friendship with the "toy" changed his character at all. The rating of this remake is 5.8/10.</p><p><h2>Les Visiteurs, 1993&nbsp;/ Just Visiting, 2000</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d4e/8b0/c6b03d59ed80979309f37c94da.jpg><p>This comedy featuring Jean Reno was released in 1993 and was rated 7/10. It's about a medieval knight that finds himself in the 20th century together with his servant. Now he has to find his way back home where his fiancé is waiting for him.</p><p>In 2000, the Holywood version of the film was shot with Jean Reno. Unfortunately, the remake turned out to be way worse (5.8/10 on IMDb). It was criticized for its flat jokes and ridiculous mistakes.</p><p><h2>LOL, 2009&nbsp;/ LOL, 2012</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8dd/440/5ed6cc555cb5789a3eba61f518.jpg><p>Thanks to this French film, director Lisa Azuelos became really famous, though its IMDb rating is rather low at 6.3/10. A few years later, the film with the same plot and title was made in Hollywood. People didn't like the new version and it got a rating of 4.4/10 on IMDb.</p><p><h2>Conan the Barbarian, 1982&nbsp;/ Conan the Barbarian, 2011</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/047/e3d/4699ed5678afc352f2ce0c02a0.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1982, the film received almost entirely good reviews and got a&nbsp;6.9/10 rating on&nbsp;IMDb. <a href=# title="Arnold Schwarzenegger" data-link=tag>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> managed to&nbsp;play a&nbsp;rude and a&nbsp;bit wild barbarian successfully. The plot is&nbsp;also brilliant: it’s a&nbsp;story about heroism and <a href=# title=courage data-link=tag>courage</a> sprinkled with pure love.</p><p>People didn’t like the new version, though <a href=# title="Jason Momoa" data-link=tag>Jason Momoa</a>’s appearance suits this role perfectly. The film is&nbsp;criticized for its trivial plot, its many special effects, and its “plain” characters. The rating for this film is&nbsp;5.2/10.</p><p><h2>Oldeuboi, 2003&nbsp;/ Oldboy, 2013</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f18/8f0/8229f752fe8b55b81dd519a25e.jpg><p>Initially, Oldboy was a Japanese manga that was filmed in Korea. This movie created by Chan-wook Park made him really famous and got an 8.4/10 rating on IMDb.</p><p>The new version shot by Spike Lee has a different plot that is less powerful than the Korean version's plot. This resulted in a 5.8/10 rating, so we recommend you watch the Korean version.</p><p><h2>Invasion of&nbsp;the Body Snatchers, 1956&nbsp;/ The Invasion, 2007</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/198/e00/2db6575efca84ae510f687ca20.jpg><p>The idea of&nbsp;Invasion of&nbsp;the Body Snatchers was so&nbsp;good that it&nbsp;was shot 3&nbsp;times in&nbsp;the 20th century: in&nbsp;1956, 1987, and 1993. You can choose any of&nbsp;these versions depending on&nbsp;your taste. For example, the IMDb rating of&nbsp;the film from 1956&nbsp;is 7.8/10.</p><p>But the version in&nbsp;2007 can’t compete with its predecessors (it’s rated 5.9/10.) First, it&nbsp;reveals the main secret at&nbsp;the beginning. Second, the plot is&nbsp;too trivial, and people who loved original films just couldn’t forgive the filmmakers for such mistakes.</p><p><h2>The Haunting, 1963&nbsp;/ The Haunting, 1999</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/420/d0a/79c10f54359cc7574f4a95d084.jpg><p>The film in&nbsp;1963 based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;the same name keeps&nbsp;us in&nbsp;suspense thanks to&nbsp;its light hints about what’s going&nbsp;on. It’s a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;film that scares&nbsp;us when nothing scary actually happens. Its rating is&nbsp;7.6/10.</p><p>The remake in&nbsp;1999 didn’t manage to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;the original version: they tried to&nbsp;replace suspense with special effects but it&nbsp;didn’t work. The rating was only 4.9/10.</p><p><h2>The Wicker Man, 1973&nbsp;/ The Wicker Man, 2006</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9eb/107/2175a35eaf807ba2884d8d5215.jpg><p>The original movie is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;classic that everyone should watch. It&nbsp;contains everything we&nbsp;need in&nbsp;a&nbsp;film: great actors, humor, and intrigue that keeps your attention till the last minute. The IMDb rating is&nbsp;7.6/10.</p><p>The remake lost all these features and turned into an&nbsp;amateur film featuring an&nbsp;unconvincing performance by&nbsp;Nicolas Cage. The rating for this film is&nbsp;3.7/10.</p><p><h2>Psycho, 1960&nbsp;/ Psycho, 1998</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d5/945/18e18b529b9ffceccb84f78630.jpg><p>Psycho in&nbsp;1998 isn’t just a&nbsp;remake, it’s a&nbsp;copy that failed. The actors’ performances were criticized strongly: Vince Vaughn as&nbsp;a&nbsp;psychopath looked ridiculous and weird. Anne Heche also failed to&nbsp;compete with Janet Lee’s portrayal. This resulted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;4.6/10 rating on&nbsp;IMDb.</p><p>That’s why we&nbsp;recommend you watch Hitchcock’s masterpiece and enjoy each moment of&nbsp;the classic film. Its rating is&nbsp;8.5/10.</p><p><h2>Wings of&nbsp;Desire, 1987&nbsp;/ City of&nbsp;Angels, 1998</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/579/c4d/37be01531795600956275dd741.jpg><p>Wings of&nbsp;Desire is&nbsp;a&nbsp;classic film with an&nbsp;8.1/10 rating on&nbsp;IMDb. It’s not just a&nbsp;story, it’s a&nbsp;commentary on&nbsp;life, death, love, and hate.</p><p>Its remake turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;cheap melodrama oversaturated with emotions that even its brilliant cast failed to&nbsp;save. All the film’s thoughts about life and death look childish and naive. Nevertheless, it&nbsp;received a&nbsp;6.7/10&nbsp;rating.</p><p><h2>The Eye, 2002&nbsp;/ The Eye, 2008</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e8/22f/6204715dc39f9964fc0278eb9c.jpg><p>This original movie from Asia tells us a story about a girl who undergoes an eye cornea transplant and starts seeing paranormal things. By the time the new version was released, the original film had already spawned 2 sequels that were popular as well. The IMDb rating is 6.7/10.</p><p>Neither ordinary people nor critics liked the new version, though the plots were quite similar. Jessica Alba was nominated for a Razzie award and got lots of bad reviews. The rating is 5.4/10.</p><p><h2>Swept Away, 1974&nbsp;/ Swept Away, 2002</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d45/66e/5a4a515c3ba7161ad36322ac02.jpg><p>Everyone who’s ever seen this Italian film remembers its powerful plot: it’s not just about sweet love, it’s about a&nbsp;standoff between 2&nbsp;worlds. Its rating is&nbsp;7.6/10.</p><p>In&nbsp;2002, the film was reshot by&nbsp;Guy Ritchie with his wife Madonna playing the main hero. The film failed at&nbsp;the box office and almost ruined Ritchie’s career. Its rating is&nbsp;3.6/10.</p><p><h2>Into the Mirror, 2003&nbsp;/ Mirrors, 2008</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/407/af8/f4fbbe524da2d13763d142c588.jpg><p>The original film was shot in 2003 in South Korea. It was a good detective story bearing a powerful idea. The rating is 6.5/10.</p><p>Though the remake was quite successful, it turned into an ordinary bloody film without any message. Even its ending didn't explain anything and left us feeling puzzled. The rating for the remake is 6.2/10.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Toy Story (1995)&nbsp;/ The Buzz Identity (2010)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5b/5f0/b2a1cd5f10afaa0dcfe60a85c5.jpg><p>Well, The Buzz Identity isn't a remake, it's a kind of funny crossover between Buzz Lightyear and <a href=#>The Bourne Identity</a> created by Warner Bros.</p><p>People usually think that The Buzz Identity is a Chinese spoof on the original Toy Story, but they're mistaken since both cartoons are originally from the same country.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know any other films that have more successful original versions?
