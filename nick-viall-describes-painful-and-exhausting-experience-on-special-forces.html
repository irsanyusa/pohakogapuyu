The former Bachelor star credited his competitors Erin Jackson and Jack Osbourne for helping him through it.</p><p>“But then I’m in this hot shower, and honestly it felt like my hands were about to explode, because you go from freezing cold to hot,” Viall recalled. “And then I just honestly never really got warm after that, so I was always constantly shaking.”&nbsp;</p><p>Viall said it was “surreal to think about” his “mental state” during his time on the show. The experience also had an impact on his body, as he shared an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a> showing his physical transformation, writing, “8 days of hell will change ya.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NICK VIALL OPENS UP ABOUT MENTAL DAMAGE OF BEING A REALITY TV STAR</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-dropped-out-of-the-competition>JoJo Siwa Dropped Out of the Competition</h2><p>JoJo Siwa <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was one of the last recruits</a> in the competition, but she chose to withdraw on the last day.
