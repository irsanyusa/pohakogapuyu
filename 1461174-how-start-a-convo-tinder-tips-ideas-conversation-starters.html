There is no one-size-fits-all approach to starting a Tinder convo. You can keep it basic and say, "Hello, how are you," and the rest of the discussion will flow naturally based on the other person. The manner in which the <a href=#>conversation progresses</a> will reveal more about you and determine whether you keep the conversation going.</p><h2>How to start a convo on Tinder with a guy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/92f61e610a03d041.jpg><p class=align-left>PAY ATTENTION: <strong>Install our <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">latest app</a> for Android, read best news on Nigeriaâ€™s #1 news app</strong></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7744184745fdc5eb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make a man interested in you whenever you are chatting or texting</span></p></a><p class=align-left>First impressions are crucial in every situation, especially when a possible relationship is on the line. Guys, on the whole, enjoy being the first to send a message. However, at times, this isn't always the case. You can <a href=#>send him a text</a> if you like him and feel the desire to communicate with him. Below are some tips on how to start a conversation on Tinder with a guy.</p><h3>1. Keep your message short and precise</h3><p class=align-left>Reading long emails or texts is tedious. People, for the most part, ignore them. As a result, it's critical to make your message short and sweet.</p><h3>2. Do not begin with "Hi"</h3><p class=align-left>No one wants to start a Tinder chat with a message that just says "Hi." In most circumstances, he will respond with "Hi too," and the interaction will end there. Instead, send a striking message that will pique his interest and make him want to chat with you. "Hello, how are you doing?" for example. "Do you have anything planned for today?"</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/15425c13fe724d0b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a conversation with a girl: Simple tips to get you started</span></p></a><h3>3. Offer him a compliment</h3><p class=align-left>Positive compliments may pique his interest in you. For example, you can comment on one of his pictures, you can congratulate him on something positive that isn't flattering. This will prompt him to tell you more or perhaps ask you questions that he believes would complement his story.</p><h3>4. Avoid being overly assertive</h3><p class=align-left>You don't want to come at them with your entire life narrative, but you also don't want to make your initial greeting too short. You shouldn't send them any further messages until they respond.</p><h3>5. Discuss common interests</h3><p class=align-left>You can talk to him about your hobbies and ask him about his. Maybe you two share a favourite program or a common interest. You can ask him about whatever it is to keep the discussion going. Plus, you'll learn a little bit about him along the way! If you're not sure what you have in common yet, have a peek at his profile or images to get a sense of his interests.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dc07c2c3b5a65ac6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to talk to girls: these useful tips will improve your communication skills</span></p></a><h3>6. Share things about yourself</h3><p class=align-left>You'll be able to get to know each other better this way. Open up to him and answer any questions he may have while you two communicate back and forth. If meeting up with you is your ultimate goal, he'll probably feel more at ease.</p><h2>How to start a conversation on Tinder with a girl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7744184745fdc5eb.jpeg><p class=align-left>Knowing how to <a href=#>text a girl</a> you like is a great deal for guys. Always keep things fun and simple when conversing or messaging a girl. Here is how to start a conversation on a dating app with a lady.</p><h3>1. Make inquiries</h3><p class=align-left>Use open-ended inquiries to keep a conversation going. These are questions to which she cannot simply respond with "yes" or "no." Instead, you can add your own responses as she responds, so you're both sharing a little bit about yourself. Consider asking questions like these:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/39f2f89071d19ef8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful and creative ways on how to ask a girl out</span></p></a><ul><li>Did you grow up somewhere?</li><li>Can you tell me how many siblings you have?</li><li>What are your favourite pastimes?</li></ul><h3>2. Send an animated GIF</h3><p class=align-left>Sending a GIF on Tinder increases your chances of getting a response by 30% and doubles the length of your discussion. GIFs might be hit or miss because you have to figure out what people think is hilarious. However, because they can be amusing, it helps to break the ice.</p><h3>3. Complement her appearance</h3><p class=align-left>Compliments are flattering to most girls. This will make her pleased, and she will want to converse with you more frequently. For example, you may tell her how much fun she is to talk to, how much you like getting to know her, or how cool she looks.</p><h3>4. Send her some adorable pictures</h3><p class=align-left>Sharing photos with a female is another fun way to text a girl. Of course, you don't have to send him photos that might make you look bad in the future, but it's a good idea to send her a photo of yourself when you think you're looking cute.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9e941178f115bcdc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to win a man's heart in easy steps</span></p></a><h3>5. Don't be negative or whiny</h3><p class=align-left>Start by telling her about your life and the things you detest as soon as possible. Keep your messages pleasant and uplifting if at all feasible. If you have any major issues that need to be addressed, you may wish to postpone them until later.</p><h3>6. Keep your messages short</h3><p class=align-left>Text messages that are too long might be exhausting. Keep your messages to one or two lines maximum when you're chatting. Don't send her paragraphs, and don't text her more than once without receiving a response. You don't want to have her read a novel when she picks up her phone, but you also don't want to bore her.</p><h2>What are some examples of Tinder conversation starters?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/15425c13fe724d0b.jpg><p class=align-left>Finding the perfect icebreaker for your first Tinder message might be difficult.
