Could young ventriloquist Ana-Maria Mărgean be one of the upcoming acts to make it through to the Finals?</strong> <strong>Could Fator himself end up being a wildcard?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-terry-fator-suggests-he-ll-be-in-the-agt-all-stars-finale>Terry Fator Suggests He’ll Be in the AGT: All-Stars Finale</h2><p>A fan on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Reddit</a> posted about a comment that former AGT winner Terry Fator made on Facebook. Fator performed in the first episode of All-Stars, but he didn’t make it through to the Finals. He recently responded to a fan’s disappointment that they wouldn’t see more of him.</p><p>Fator told the fan to “keep watching,” adding, “I might just make a surprise appearance in the finals…”</p><p>Some viewers are wondering what this comment means. One fan responded by suggesting that he could be performing with another ventriloquist in the Finals, like he did with past contestants Darci Lynne and Celia Muñoz.</p><p>Young BGT ventriloquist Jamie Leahey already performed and was eliminated. So that would leave Romania’s Got Talent winner Ana-Maria Mărgean. The 13-year-old ventriloquist will perform later in the season for a chance to make it into the Finals.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MEET THE 60 ACTS ON ‘AGT’ ALL-STARS — WATCH THEIR AUDITIONS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-could-fator-be-a-wildcard-in-the-finals>Could Fator Be a Wildcard in the Finals?</h2><p>It’s interesting that Fator wrote about making an appearance in the Finals, not the finale. That suggests that he’ll be a competitor rather than a guest performer. Could Fator return as a wildcard in the All-Stars Finals?</p><p>Each week, 10 acts perform, and two of them are sent to the Finals. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NBC</a>, there will be five Golden Buzzer acts this season — three from the judges, one from host Terry Crews, and one from all four of them together.</p><p>NBC also confirms that there will be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">11 acts in the Finals</a>. Considering there are presumably six weeks of competition before the Finals (with 10 acts in each episode, totaling 60), that seems to suggest that six acts will be chosen by the Superfans, with the five Golden Buzzers bringing the total to 11.</p><p>That doesn’t seem to leave room for a wildcard, unless the show surprises us.
