But why is this so?</p><h2>What is a karmic relationship?</h2><p class=align-left>This is the kind of association whose end goal is to have those involved learning something that would help them grow spiritually. It is never easy when beginning with slight disagreements that could blow into massive arguments.</p><p class=align-left>It is common to hear cases of people being stuck and hardly know what to do to get out.

One of the obvious signs includes having doubts about being in one or not. Others are mentioned below.</p><h3>1. They repeat patterns</h3><p class=align-left>The first major sign is that you are always on and off your relationship. You seem to have an issue that warrants you taking a break every time it gets overwhelming.</p><p class=align-left>You should consider it a red flag if the issues keep arising in repetitive patterns more so if they tend to keep you stagnated.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1296b4fff1d4c0a9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best tips on how to be a good boyfriend</span></p></a><h3>2. Selfishness rules</h3><p class=align-left>Relationships are supposed to be about putting your partner first. However, karmic relationships are different and appear as though one partner slaves for the other since only one person's needs seem to matter most.</p><p class=align-left>Sadly, this kind of relationship has no boundaries. Partners do not have a sense of healthy boundaries and majorly focus on their self-interest and needs as opposed to thinking about the partner.</p><p class=align-left>These relationships are a perfect definition of what an abusive or co-dependent relationship complex would be like. Usually, one of the partners will be well invested while the other person enjoys it only because of its convenience.</p><h3>3. The relationship is addictive</h3><p class=align-left>In most cases, such relationships are characterized by highs and lows, which are often filled by passionate intensity. Usually, the partners may not be in love but love the idea of love as painted in books, social media, as well as how it all works for their professional status.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2f67e6e919d0f2c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top flirty memes to send your partner when bored</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is all superficial and thin-lined, and there are no true emotions.</p><h3>4. Partners are controlling</h3><p class=align-left>In most cases, one of the partners feels entitled and will do his or her best to control the other. Usually, they make the other person their center of attention and the main source of your happiness.</p><p class=align-left>The oppressed partner can put the other one on a pedestal, hence will be unable to realize any mistakes and flaws in them.</p><h3>5. Your love feels destined for you</h3><p class=align-left>In most cases, people in such relationships feel like they cannot live without the other person. They tend to have deep feelings for their partners.</p><p class=align-left>This makes them believe that they were created to fit perfectly into each other's lives. It is impossible to imagine a life without the other one; hence will consistently try to make it work with the hope that you will get it right.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ffe0cbd75bf36b7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Understanding pistanthrophobia: Meaning, signs and remedies</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The abusive partners in such cases are very difficult to resist since they keep drawing you in. It can only end when you decide that you have learnt your lesson and are ready to walk away.</p><h3>6. There is an instant connection</h3><p class=align-left>In such relationships, the couple feels attracted to each other instantly. The person you care for feels perfect, and there is some form of familiarity hence the easy attraction.</p><h3>7. They create dependency</h3><p class=align-left>When you are in a karmic relationship, the chances are that you start feeling too consumed by them because they are all you think about. All your emotions, mental thoughts, and physical attractions are focused on only one person.</p><p class=align-left>All decisions you make will first consider the person you are in love with even before yourself. You always feel the need to call them even before making the basics of decisions.</p><h3>8. They bring out your worst fears</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/acbb367fcf821043.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs that you are falling out of love and should end your relationship</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Partners in karmic relationships tend to make you relive your fear every day. You tend to worry about the worst fears, including fear of loss, abandonment, rejection, lack of commitment, and fear of the unknown.</p><p class=align-left>You always seem as though you are guarding your every move. You are always living on the verge of your life, worried about what could come out from your past.</p><h3>9. Irrational behaviours</h3><p class=align-left>Your weakest vulnerabilities are likely to be exposed when dating a karmic partner. They tend to remind you of your worst insecurities and bring out your worst behaviours.</p><p class=align-left>It is possible that you may lose yourself and start acting in a manner that will surprise you, too, just because you want to make your partner accept and adore you. You may develop strange behaviours in the process as you struggle to impress him or her.</p><h3>10. They reveal your dark side</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b737661fe0be63e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>70+ interesting questions to ask your boyfriend when bored</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Perfection is elusive and impossible to achieve. However, partners need to motivate each other and push themselves to exhibit the very best.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, in karmic relationships, you will notice most of your darker side coming to light because your partner tends to provoke you.</p><p class=align-left>Instead of growing and encouraging your best side to present itself, they push you to show your most undesirable and difficult traits. You may even be unaware of some of the traits that you suddenly develop.</p><p class=align-left>Sadly, this person will show and remind you that you are very human, even though it may be painful.</p><h3>11.

You will feel volatile all the time, and comfort or security will be the last thing on your mind.</p><p class=align-left>It seems as though you cannot have a moment of peace in life when you are with this person.

They drive you crazy</h3><p class=align-left>In most cases, a karmic partner does not give you peace. This may not be intentional but for some reason the two of you seem to bring out only the worst in each other despite being in love.</p><h3>13. Short-lived relationships</h3><p class=align-left>It is common knowledge that such unions never last as long as loving ones would. Those involved cannot endure the pain that comes with it, which means that sustaining it for longer than is necessary could be tragic.</p><p class=align-left>Realizing the direction which your relationship is going, and making a decision early enough will save you the trouble of the heartbreak that is inevitable in the future.</p><h3>14. You feel unsafe</h3><p class=align-left>Instead of feeling all comfortable and free around the person you claim to love, you often appear guarded and protective of your space. You put up walls and hardly let your partner in on your secret, because you do not feel safe being with them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4b293eaea45d8328.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>These top 20 Nietzsche quotes will challenge your outlook on life</span></p></a><h2>Rewards of being in a karmic relationship</h2><p class=align-left>The beauty of love is that it brings something positive.

If you desire to do this, consider the following suggestions.</p><p class=align-left>You can easily break free of karmic relationships, especially when they get to dangerously toxic levels. You should not hold on for too long once you learn your lesson. Let go and start building a new and better life.</p><p class=align-left>Every person who feels stuck should look within themselves and discover their true essence. This way, they can struggle to get out of a seemingly impossible yet hurtful relationship that will never yield any positive results.</p><p class=align-left>To do this, a deliberate effort is required. Fortunately, with the right steps, everything is achievable. Below are a few suggestions that could work.</p><h3>1. Breaking familiar old patterns</h3><p class=align-left>Make sure your self-esteem is so high, such that you never feel comfortable staying in difficult situations. Be careful not to be pulled into the whirlwind of repetition, especially when it concerns bad habits.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytine4ls7ui58.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 hilarious and wise Nigerian proverbs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Even though creating new patterns can be daunting, it may be the best thing to do for yourself when dealing with a karmic relationship. Strive to cut links with bad patterns.</p><h3>2. Second chances</h3><p class=align-left>When you know that there will always be a second chance, then you can slowly take things a day at a time. You will not be too hard on yourself when you fail to leave the abusive bond the first time.</p><p class=align-left>While it is important to break unhealthy patterns, make sure you take it a step at a time to avoid making mistakes.</p><h3>3. Differentiate between love and karma</h3><p class=align-left>Real love is peaceful, joyful, and respectful, as it gives you room to grow. Every time you feel like you are living life on a roller coaster, then you need to stop and examine yourself.</p><h3>4. Accept and make a move</h3><p class=align-left>Most people in this kind of engagement seem oblivious to the obvious signs that family and friends see with ease. Unfortunately, no amount of convincing or being shown the reality on the ground can help them overcome their addiction to toxic alliances.</p><p class=align-left>It is crucial for the oppressed partner to acknowledge that they are in a bad place. This marks the beginning of their healing, which can only happen if they are ready to start taking necessary action.</p><h3>5. You have a unique path</h3><p class=align-left>Appreciating your uniqueness will help you understand the value of your karmic lesson. This way, you can easily make choices to beat your fears and weaknesses.</p><p class=align-left>Do not sweat the pressure that arises from those around you. Do what works for you and focus on healing.</p><p class=align-left>A karmic relationship can be the best thing that happens to anyone who needs to learn a few things before settling down. Knowing when to call it quits can save you a lot of troubles and heartaches too.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnR%2Bk21wbmWnna61ecBmopqqnZ6wbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2auqKqbYr%2Bmrctmo6KelWO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
