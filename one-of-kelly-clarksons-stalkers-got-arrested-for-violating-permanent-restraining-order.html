After working to get a permanent restraining order, one of her alleged stalkers continues showing up to her home. The said stalker was arrested in account of all 12 times she has violated the terms of the restraining orders.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-one-of-clarkson-s-stalkers-who-continued-to-violate-restraining-orders-got-arrested-again>One of Clarkson’s Stalkers Who Continued To Violate Restraining Orders Got Arrested Again</h2><p>Clarkson’s immediately filed for a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">temporary restraining</a> order when two individuals repeatedly showed up on her San Fernando Valley home. A month after getting the temporary restraining orders, Clarkson was also granted permanent restraining orders on January 19, 2023.</p><p>One of the individuals who kept visiting her house, Huguette Nicole Young, continued her uninvited visitations. This is done even after restraining orders were placed against her. When security noticed her wandering around Clarkson’s property, they contacted 911 and police arrived shortly and arrested her.</p><p>Young was said to have violated the restraining orders 12 times, her frequent visitations mostly occur at 8:59 p.m. According to the source, the docs also claim that Young placed presents on the porch of the house. These include dog toys, stickers, plants, and seeds.</p><p>Clarkson has a decade-long history with Young. She first tracked down her Nashville home and then followed her to Los Angeles. Clarkson is so concerned, that according to those close to her, she will not allow her children to go outside the gate at night.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her Stalker Situation Was What Prompted The Talk Show Move To New York</h2><p>Clarkson is currently in talks to move <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>‘s production to the east coast. Among other reasons that are rumored to have caused the move, the singer’s current situation with stalkers may have been the deciding factor.</p><p>“Kelly is in talks to move production of The Kelly Clarkson Show to New York, she initiated the conversation because the woman keeps returning to her house,” A source said. “She feels unsafe with a stalker on the loose and is having sleepless nights over her children’s safety, too. She has temporarily fled the property and is staying in a secret location,”</p><p>Another reason that the insider has discussed on why the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">singer</a> wants to move to the east coast is that Clarkson “finds the traffic terrible,” in Los Angeles. Clarkson reportedly also find the people “kind of flaky,” and she feels like New York would be a better place to raise her children.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_JonasBrothers_Amy-SussmanGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="The Jonas Brothers Inducted Into Hollywood Walk of Fame, Reveals New Album Release Date" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zqecZqeWYrimuMuyZJykkae4tLvNrGSsrJGhuKa%2B0maeqKxdlr%2BzsdKtnJ1llqS%2FbsLIqKOarJmjtG68xKukmqaVo8FuvsSsq6uZmaO2r7OMqKmdnaJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
