And while he&nbsp;made lots of&nbsp;people sight over the years, it&nbsp;was the beautiful Nicole Kimpel who managed to&nbsp;conquer his heart.</p><p>At&nbsp;62, the actor confesses to&nbsp;being in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> and happy with his partner. But so&nbsp;far, we&nbsp;haven’t had the opportunity to&nbsp;know much about her. That’s until now. And we’re so&nbsp;glad to&nbsp;know her better because she’s super charming.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> loves discovering and sharing love exploits, so&nbsp;today we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;tell you how it&nbsp;all started for this couple.</p><p><h2>At&nbsp;first, they were far away from each other.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/082/dc9/64a1655c37a4ad2e3ee54ee1cb.jpg><p>Antonio was born in&nbsp;the south of&nbsp;Spain, in&nbsp;Malaga, and did not always dream of&nbsp;being an&nbsp;actor. His first passion was soccer. He&nbsp;trained hard and was committed to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;professional athlete one day. But fate had other plans for him, and after suffering an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>injury</a>, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;that dream. Slowly but surely, he&nbsp;delved deeper and deeper into the idea of&nbsp;acting.</p><p>Twenty years later, more than 2,000 kilometers away, Nicole was born in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Germany data-link=tag>Germany</a>. Due to&nbsp;her father’s profession, she spent much of&nbsp;her childhood living in&nbsp;different cities. Not only did this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nomadic</a> lifestyle help her learn many languages (French, German, English, Dutch, Italian, Arabic, and Spanish), but it&nbsp;also gave her great cultural insights.</p><p><h2>But fate had its way and brought them together.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/280/071/59c3ed5785920c94782745592c.jpg><p>The actor and the financial advisor met at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party held during the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. A&nbsp;very peculiar situation took place, according to&nbsp;Antonio, who only spoke about it&nbsp;later.</p><p>At&nbsp;that time, Antonio did not know that his current girlfriend-to-be had a&nbsp;twin sister almost identical to&nbsp;her called Barbara. It&nbsp;was her sister who caught his eye and he&nbsp;did not hesitate to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;her, “but suddenly Nicole appeared, and my&nbsp;heart skipped a&nbsp;beat. They are exactly alike, but&nbsp;I saw something that stood out in&nbsp;her, that made me&nbsp;click with Nicole,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a> Antonio. But back then, he&nbsp;was still married to&nbsp;his ex-wife, Melanie Griffith, so&nbsp;that first meeting was simply friendly.</p><p><h2>Together they dared to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out of&nbsp;their comfort zone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/538/56a/844a5b55d6812cdb800c63c651.jpg><p>Once Melanie’s and Antonio’s divorce papers were finalized, he&nbsp;and Nicole resumed contact and finally formalized their relationship. Once they were together, Banderas made a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>statement</a> that surprised the media and his fans: he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;would leave <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> indefinitely to&nbsp;attend to&nbsp;other interests in&nbsp;his life.</p><p>After that, he&nbsp;and his partner went to&nbsp;London to&nbsp;study fashion design. Once they finished the course, they got down to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;their first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>big project together</a>, the exclusive and successful clothing line Antonio Banderas Design. Each of&nbsp;them brought something different to&nbsp;the team. They complemented each other perfectly and managed to&nbsp;make their new brand successful.</p><p><h2>Antonio’s health problems strengthened their relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9d/2ef/7db9fc57e780a03fbeb2844e09.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;2019 Antonio had to&nbsp;face some serious health problems. The actor suffered a&nbsp;heart attack, and according to&nbsp;him, Nicole’s quick reaction saved his life: “When I&nbsp;started having symptoms, she knew what was happening. She put an&nbsp;aspirin under my&nbsp;tongue, and that saved my&nbsp;life. I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;second chance, and some things have changed in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life since then,” the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a>.</p><p>Their relationship grew even stronger, their bond became more intense, and they decided to&nbsp;start paying attention to&nbsp;the most essential things in&nbsp;life. “The things that&nbsp;I gave a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;importance to&nbsp;stopped being important. I&nbsp;switched to&nbsp;paying attention to&nbsp;the real things. My&nbsp;daughter is&nbsp;the real thing, my&nbsp;friends, my&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.”</p><p><h2>They got a&nbsp;second chance to&nbsp;enjoy life together.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/089/b2e/f6ebc058108c627ef47d53614c.jpg><p>Although they had been living between England, Spain, and the United States for a&nbsp;long time, they decided to&nbsp;settle down in&nbsp;Andalusia after Antonio’s heart attack. The Malagueño has often demonstrated openly and publicly the great love and pride he&nbsp;feels for his homeland, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;has not hesitated to&nbsp;make some time in&nbsp;his busy schedule to&nbsp;show his partner every corner of&nbsp;that beautiful land.</p><p>Nicole is&nbsp;very clear about her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opinion</a> of&nbsp;living in&nbsp;Spain. “I&nbsp;miss my&nbsp;family because&nbsp;I don’t spend as&nbsp;much time with them as&nbsp;before, but my&nbsp;place is&nbsp;next to&nbsp;Antonio, and that makes up&nbsp;for everything else. I&nbsp;am very happy in&nbsp;Malaga, the city has welcomed me&nbsp;with open arms, and&nbsp;I feel like a&nbsp;real Malagueña”.</p><p><h2>They have just celebrated their eighth anniversary.</h2></p><p>The media love marriage announcements, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not unusual for them to&nbsp;always speculate about it&nbsp;and ask about it&nbsp;in&nbsp;every interview, but for now, there are no&nbsp;wedding bells in&nbsp;the Banderas’ household, nor does it&nbsp;seem that there will be&nbsp;any time soon.</p><p>The actor has clarified his position on&nbsp;the matter, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>: “I’m kind of&nbsp;married. Nicole is&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife, and I’m her man. We’re doing great.” Married or&nbsp;not, we&nbsp;love to&nbsp;see them happily enjoying their love to&nbsp;the fullest, and we&nbsp;hope they keep those big love smiles on&nbsp;their faces for a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>What is&nbsp;your favorite celebrity couple?
