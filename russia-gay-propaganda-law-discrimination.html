It also prohibits Russians from promoting or “praising” homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are “normal.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Human rights groups say this development marks another instance of persecution faced by the LGBTQ community in Russia, amid a major backslide in recent years. “The LGBT+ community should not be used as an instrument of ideological confrontation by an undemocratic regime,” says Dilya Gafurova, the head of Sphere Foundation in St. Petersburg.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Below, the latest on the bill signed by Putin.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What does the “gay propaganda” bill say?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The new “gay propaganda” bill expands on existing legislation that was adopted by the Kremlin in 2013 to promote “traditional” family values in Russia. The 2013 law prohibited depictions of homosexuality, same-sex unions, and “non-traditional sexual relations” to be shown to minors. The new bill would extend those restrictions to all ages.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The bill also bans what authorities describe as the “propaganda of pedophilia and sex change.” While the concept of propaganda is loosely defined under the bill, it strictly prohibits the use of any medium to spread any related information.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Essentially, it’s a total ban of being LGBT+ in Russia,” says Gafurova.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">When is the new law expected to go into effect?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the bill on Monday, Dec. 5, effectively outlawing any public expression of LGBT behavior or lifestyle in Russia. The Kremlin did not immediately announce Putin’s signature, but the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, published a copy of the measure on their website.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In November, Duma approved the bill in its third and final reading. From there, the bill got approval at the Federation Council, or the upper house of parliament.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gafurova, the Russian LGBT advocate, expected Putin to sign it into legislation as early as December this year or January 2023, and described the process as “rushed.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Russian Activists Just Won an Important Battle Over LGBTQ Rights. But the War Is Far From Over</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What consequences will the Russian LGBTQ community face?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Duma, said on social media that “any propaganda of non-traditional relationships will have consequences.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the bill does not make violations a criminal offense, they will be punishable by fines ranging from 100,000 to 2 million rubles ($1,660-$33,000). Non-residents who commit certain violations can also face expulsion from Russia after 15 days of detention.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gafurova says that although the previous law was rarely used against individuals—and mostly enforced against websites or individual protestors from speaking up—now, it will allow authorities to go on a “witch hunt.” It will also have other far-reaching implications, she adds: “It has complicated our lives because the wording is so vague that it can be used in an arbitrary fashion.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some lawmakers have also shown support for an independent bill that would make any so-called “gay propaganda” a criminal offense, <a href=# rel=noopener>according</a> to the Associated Press.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Where do LGBTQ rights stand in Russia?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Russia decriminalized homosexuality in 1993, but homophobia and discrimination is still rife. The country today ranks 46 out of 49 for LGBTQ inclusion in European countries by the watchdog, ILGA-Europe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2020, Russia explicitly outlawed same-sex marriages in the country’s constitution by adopting amendments stipulating that the institution of marriage is “a union between a man and a woman.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Putin, who aligns closely with the Orthodox Church, has publicly rejected same-sex relationships. In speeches given at the Kremlin, he has also railed against same-sex marriages and parenthood by these couples. “Do we really want here, in our country, in Russia, instead of ‘mum’ and ‘dad,’ to have ‘parent number one,’ ‘parent number two,’ or ‘parent number three’?” he said in September. “Have they gone completely insane?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">LGBTQ advocates in Russia have reported many cases of hate and violence against the community. Pride events previously held in <a href=# rel=noopener>St. Petersburg</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Moscow</a> have been marked by state violence and arrests, while an increase in the number of attacks on LGBTQ people throughout Russia—both by individuals and by organized homophobic groups—increased after the 2013 law, according to a 2014 <a href=# rel=noopener>report</a> published by Human Rights Watch.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Public sentiment also reflects low tolerance for LGBTQ recognition: in a <a href=# rel=noopener>global poll</a> conducted by Ipsos in April and May of 2021, 52% of respondents in Russia were against same-sex marriage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Sphere Foundation’s Gafurova says she’s encountered widespread support for the newly-passed bill. “It’s very depressing for us, but it falls in line with traditional ideas of family values in Russia,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Russia’s Anti-Gay Laws: How a Dutch Activist Got Caught in the Crosshairs</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How are human rights advocates responding to this law?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia’s “gay propaganda law” was discriminatory, promoted homophobia, and violated the European Convention on Human Rights and that it “served no legitimate public interest.” The court rejected suggestions that public debate on LGBTQ issues could influence children to become homosexual or that it threatened public morals.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, the Sphere Foundation says they will continue to appeal to Russian citizens and MPs to prevent the law from coming into effect through <a href=# rel=noopener>national</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>global</a> petitions—so far, close to 120,000 people have signed the petitions online, including over 83,000 Russians. They group will also continue to provide support to the LGBTQ community virtually.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We wanted to at least try to give people hope,” says Gafurova.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamNrhXN%2BjqusrKuZlnqordhmp6unoJa0orrDmmSlmadisaq%2FwqugpqGelsGqu81o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
