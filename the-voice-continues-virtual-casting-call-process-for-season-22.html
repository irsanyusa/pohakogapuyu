The virtual casting process for Season 22 is already well underway. Like the previous two seasons, all casting will be done through video submissions and virtual open calls. We’ve got your back in case you need a refresher on how to sign up.</strong></p><p>Virtual open calls for The Voice will take place on Oct. 19 and 20. The first thing you need to do is create an official artist’s account on The Voice <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>. This is where you choose if you want to audition solo, or as a duo or trio. You must be 13 or older to audition. If you are 12, you must turn 13 by the cutoff date provided. After making your profile, participants will be able to select a date and time to perform their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">virtual audition</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-do-the-voice-virtual-open-calls-work>How Do ‘The Voice’ Virtual Open Calls Work?</h2><p>Each artist will have a minute and 30 seconds to introduce themselves and perform a song. Log into your account at the time of your scheduled audition and click the blue button for a 10-second countdown. Once you finish recording, The Voice casting team will review your submission. Your results will be emailed to you and posted on your artist account.</p><p>There was a lot of confusion leading into Season 21 from artists who did not hear back from the casting team after their virtual auditions. The Voice sees thousands of people, if not more, audition every single year. It takes the casting team a long time to sift through all of the submissions. Do not be discouraged if you do not hear back. If you do not hear back or do not go through to the next round of casting, you can register for the next virtual open call 24 hours after your previous one was completed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>There are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>four more virtual casting call dates</a> throughout November and December. Instagram flooded with questions about whether or not Grande would be coaching next season. Fans would love a chance to potentially audition in front of her should their virtual submissions go well.</p><p>The casting call did feature the promo image with this season’s coaches. It has not yet been confirmed if Grande, Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson, and John Legend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">will be returning</a> next season. The Voice does have a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rotating panel of coaches</a> so it’s not uncommon for them to bring in a brand new coach once in a while.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-597175774.jpeg alt="Grimes Premieres New Song After “Privacy Invasion, Bad Press, Online Hate and Harassment”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecKopa2hnqqytHnVoqmtrZGheqSt0q2gp59dmK6tuIypqaiblajAbrLOq2SsnZGovK95kWtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
