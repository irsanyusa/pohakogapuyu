According to a <a href=# id=d5f68cbc-3187-331b-a228-5da8010d3dcc>recent paper</a> by University of California-Berkeley professor Gabriel Zucman, the top 1% in the country own 40% of the country's wealth.</p><p>" <a href=# id=6717ca8d-a278-3fc3-aeb4-09e723f882db>I think the American dream is lost</a> ," said Bridgewater Associates founder and billionaire Ray Dalio on a recent CBS broadcast. Dalio, who was the highest-grossing hedge fund manager in 2018, pulling in $2 billion in total compensation, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have said populism and a trend toward more extreme political stances are inevitable results of this inequality.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="ray dalio"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/IjVktktTURBXy83NDUyZjUxYS01NzIzLTRjOGUtYTdmNC05OTJkYzdkNzA5YWEuanBnkZUCzQMWzQShwsM></span><p>One attendee, Guggenheim Partners' Alan Schwartz, <a href=# id=01f6a852-b3ac-3416-a12f-6286fdbd9434>said</a> "what's really coming is class warfare."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The rise of Democratic Socialism is marked by the popularity of freshman congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez from New York, who unseated long-time incumbent Joe Crawley in a primary with a message of changing the system entirely. She has made waves pushing for a Green New Deal in Congress, and several candidates running for the Democratic nomination for President have pitched wealth taxes to soak the super-rich.</p><p>"I don't want to be a tone deaf CEO; while the company is doing fine, it is absolutely obvious that a big chunk of [people] have been left behind," Dimon said at an event in March unveiling a new $350 million program by the bank to help people in underserved communities get jobs.</p><p>While President Donald Trump rode the support of people struggling to make ends meet to the White House, his policies have only been exacerbated the divide between the haves and the have-nots, experts say, with his tax reform being the primary point of contention. Major corporations like Dimon's have used the savings they have gotten from the tax bill not to pay workers' higher salaries or create new branches, but to buy back stock, boosting their share prices and helping the minority of the American population that is invested in the stock market.</p><p>No billionaire is calling for a regime change yet. The biggest cheers at Milken reportedly came when a video of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher played, where she said "to be free, you must be a capitalist."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>His comment led to some on Twitter to question Griffin's selective knowledge of history, put succinctly by New York Times contributor and best-selling author Diana Henriques.</p><p>"Plutocrats who sputter about class warfare without addressing inequality need to brush up on the 1920s."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7z6ijoqyZmMBwsdWepWaamaG5qrvNmqCrnaNirrOxjJqapKafrLmmsMaipaBlpJ2utXnToZxmq6mowaa5jK2fmqxdmL%2BmrdOem2asmJq2s3nCq5izsV2WurDBza1mb6VjboB4xg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogNews - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
