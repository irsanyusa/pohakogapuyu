We are ready to break this cycle!&nbsp;</p><p>So, what is the <a href=#>best way to learn Spanish</a> and finally check off that box? We’ve put together 10 tips to kickstart your learning. ¡Acompáñanos! (Come along with us!).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-best-way-to-learn-spanish-in-10-tips>The best way to learn Spanish in 10 tips</h2><p>When learning a new language, it’s essential to find methods and techniques that fit your schedule, goals and learning style. With the internet at your disposal, there’s no shortage of tools to test-drive!</p><p>Indeed, finding the right setup is key to staying consistent and advancing in your journey. How? Well, the more consistent you are, the more progress you’ll make… and the more progress you make, the more you’ll want to learn (AKA: motivation).</p><p>So, we’ve broken down some of the most effective ways to learn Spanish to help you make progress in your journey.</p><p>Ready? Let’s go!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-start-with-the-basics>1. Start with the basics</h3><p>When diving into a new language, it’s essential to start from the ground up. Familiarizing yourself with the basics will set the stage for a smoother road and give you the push to get the ball rolling.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some pointers on where to begin:</p><ul><li>Alphabet and its sounds: Watch online videos of native Spanish speakers spelling out the alphabet. Pay attention to each sound and mimic it. If you are in an online Spanish class, ask your teacher to repeat these sounds for you often.</li><li>Numbers: Start by learning the numbers from one to ten, then move on to higher figures. You’ll find that there are simple patterns to follow!</li><li>Pronouns: Learn all pronouns, as they’re essential for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish verb conjugation</a>.</li><li>Common vocabulary: Make a list of everyday vocabulary, starting with essentials like sí (yes), no (no), por favor (please), gracias (thanks) and nouns related to food, clothing and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">household</a>.</li></ul><p>Okay, the grammar side of things may not always be the most exciting part of taking up a new language. Nevertheless, learning correct grammar is exactly what will give our skills a solid base. Grammar is the bedrock of effective communication.</p><p>This is why it’s particularly important to pay extra attention to grammar rules from the very beginning. This will avoid headaches later on. By investing time and effort in studying grammar, we can expand our vocabulary, form correct sentences, and communicate much faster than if we didn’t.</p><p>However, we can all acknowledge that grammar is one of the trickiest pieces of the puzzle. This is true, especially if your native language’s rules differ significantly from Spanish. So, here are some key points we believe you should concentrate on to build a strong foundation:</p><ul><li><strong>Gender.</strong> Gender is an essential feature of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish grammar</a>. Nearly all nouns are masculine or feminine or have gendered variations, such as maestra (female teacher) and maestro (male teacher). Note that adjectives and pronouns should match the gender of the noun.</li><li><strong>Practice your verbs.</strong> Spanish verb conjugation changes the word endings based on tense and person (first person, second person, third person singular/plural, etc.). Practicing the most common verbs and their conjugations is beyond helpful if you’re aiming to learn the language quickly.</li><li><strong>Word order.</strong> In Spanish, it’s common to see sentences where the subject or noun is placed after the verb (for example ese pastel lo hice yo, meaning ‘I made that cake’ but literally translated as ‘that cake I made it’).<br>When it comes to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish adjectives</a>, they typically come after the noun instead of before (la casa grande, ’the big house’, instead of literally translating la grande casa).</li></ul><p>Seems like a lot? No worries – you don’t have to navigate this alone. Learning from experienced Spanish teachers is the best way to make sure you study the right rules at the right time and with the right feedback. Indeed, that’s where platforms like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lingoda</a> come in!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start with Lingoda today</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-visuals-visuals-visuals>3. Visuals, visuals, visuals</h3><p>Phew, we got the heavier stuff out of the way! So, how can we make all this learning more fun and engaging? Visuals, visuals, visuals. Who doesn’t love multimedia? Movies, TV or video series, documentaries…whatever strikes your fancy.</p><p>Using media is hands down one of the most effective ways to learn Spanish (or any language, really). Movies and shows, for instance, help us pick up new words through context without the need for translation. They also familiarize us with a language’s natural sounds and rhythm. Plus, if we’re hooked on a storyline, we’ll want to keep watching. This boosts our time commitment and skills even more.</p><p>Were you thinking of canceling your Hulu subscription? Think again! Leverage it as an educational resource!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you’re a beginner or intermediate-level learner, it might be best to choose something with a familiar plot. This way, you can focus on the language rather than the story.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-hit-play-on-that-podcast>4. Hit ‘play’ on that podcast</h3><p>Like movies and series, podcasts are a fantastic tool to support our Spanish studies, especially now that media is so portable (hooray technology!). Whether we’re on our commute, cooking dinner or sweating it out on the treadmill, we can whip out a phone or tablet and use that time to study.</p><p>The best part is that with endless podcast options available in so many languages, we can definitely find something that will interest us and keep us motivated. Are you into history? Great. Pop culture? No doubt. Gardening? Definitely! You can find Spanish-language content on any topic.</p><p>Listening to native speakers tell stories helps us work on pronunciation, sentence structure and everyday vocabulary. The fact that we can rewind or restart a podcast as many times as we need makes it all the more useful. You can focus on nailing that tricky sound you’ve been struggling with, for example.</p><p>Additionally, if you’re looking for something suitable for a beginner, there are podcasts with easy-to-follow stories specifically designed to assist language learners (hint: Lingoda’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">El Viaje Español</a>).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-get-singing>5. Get singing</h3><p>We can’t stress enough how beneficial it is to listen to native speakers set to music when we’re learning a new language. With media being so accessible worldwide, we can (and should!) grab every chance to engage with content in our target language, specifically music.</p><p>In fact, research has found that listening to music is one of the most effective tools for language learning. In short, songs can help us:</p><ul><li><strong>Memorize new vocabulary and phrases:</strong> A song’s melody helps us connect lyrics to music, making them easier to remember. This will enrich our vocabulary.</li><li><strong>Get acquainted with cadence, pronunciation and tone</strong>: This is great if we’re aiming to develop an authentic accent and work on our listening skills.</li><li><strong>Gain cultural knowledge:</strong> Music exposes us to slang and cultural nuances, giving us a deeper understanding of the language and its context.</li></ul><p>Just having music playing in the background can be helpful. Even better? Singing along of course. This is the best way to get the most out of it. So, warm up those vocal cords and go on the hunt for a fun salsa or cumbia playlist! There is no shortage of amazing talent to choose from (Selena, Juan Gabriel, Natalia Lafourcade… we could go on).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-start-early-with-reading-comprehension>6. Start early with reading comprehension</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reading practice in Spanish</a> is a vital part of language learning – it opens up a whole new world for us! Just imagine being able to read books by all those brilliant Spanish-speaking authors in their original language – think Isabel Allende (one of the most famous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chilean writers</a>), Gabriel Garciá Márquez, Julio Cortázar, just to name a few.</p><p>Our advice here is to begin working on your reading comprehension early in your studies. This way, you can progress gradually and build up your confidence. Start with short stories and children’s books, then slowly tackle more challenging material as you become more proficient.</p><p>On that note, remember to be kind to yourself if you don’t understand some vocabulary. Move past it and look it up later (or make sense of it from context) – everything will click sooner or later, as long as you don’t give your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish reading practice</a> up!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-surround-yourself-with-the-most-spanish-you-can>7. Surround yourself with the most Spanish you can</h3><p>When you’re starting to learn Spanish, immersing yourself as much as possible in the language will work wonders. It speeds up your learning by exposing you to new vocabulary, grammar structures and correct pronunciation. But how can we do that if we’re not living in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish-speaking country</a>?</p><p>Here are some good tips to get around that:</p><ul><li>Switch your phone, social media and other app settings to Spanish</li><li>Watch movies and videos or TV series in Spanish or with Spanish subtitles</li><li>Listen to music and podcasts in Spanish while you drive, exercise, cook, etc…</li><li>Write down Spanish vocabulary on sticky notes and place them around your desk, kitchen, bathroom, etc</li><li>Read news articles and current event blogs in Spanish</li><li>Make your shopping or to-do lists in Spanish</li><li>Join a language exchange or ask your Spanish-speaking friends to help you practice (see below)</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-take-every-chance-to-speak-spanish>8. Take every chance to speak Spanish</h3><p>We’ve all been there when learning a new language. Our reading, listening and writing skills improve steadily, but when it comes to speaking… our brain freezes. The best way to address this? Practice your speaking as much as possible! This is a confidence issue, not a knowledge problem.</p><p>Regardless of your level, we recommend seeking out opportunities to speak Spanish from the get-go. For example,&nbsp; join a language exchange group or ask your Spanish-speaking family or friends to practice with you. Start with simple conversations and, as you progress, gradually incorporate more advanced vocabulary.</p><p>If you’re committed to polishing your speaking skills, it’s important that you overcome any fear of making mistakes and that you remain open to feedback. This is what will really get you on a roll!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-consider-online-spanish-classes>9. Consider online Spanish classes</h3><p>Thanks to today’s interconnectivity, we can learn from the experts no matter where we are. Lingoda, for instance, collaborates with native-level professionals worldwide, offering learners full schedule flexibility and other perks.</p><p>In other words: Do you have an internet connection and a computer or smartphone nearby?

Take a trip to a Spanish-speaking country</h3><p>Learning a new language is one of the best things you can do if you’re exploring other cultures and countries. Spanish, in particular, opens the door to jaw-dropping places like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Puerto Rico</a>, Mexico or Colombia (The food! The sights! The sun!).</p><p>So, if you have the chance, we 100% recommend booking that ticket and immersing yourself in the language. It’s the perfect opportunity to practice your skills in real-life scenarios, from listening comprehension to speaking.</p><p>After all, there’s nothing like being surrounded by your target language 24/7 to really boost your motivation and soak it all in.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-the-most-effective-way-to-learn-spanish-nbsp>What is the most effective way to learn Spanish?&nbsp;</h2><p>So, the ultimate question is: What is actually the best and most effective way to learn Spanish?
